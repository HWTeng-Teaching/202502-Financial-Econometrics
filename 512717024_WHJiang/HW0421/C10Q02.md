## C10Q02

The labor supply of married women has been a subject of a great deal of economic research. Consider the following supply‑equation specification

HOURS=𝛽1+𝛽2WAGE+𝛽3EDUC+𝛽4AGE+𝛽5KIDSL6+𝛽6NWIFEINC+𝑒

where HOURS is the supply of labor, WAGE is hourly wage, EDUC is years of education, KIDSL6 is the number of children in the household who are less than 6 years old, and NWIFEINC is household income from sources other than the wife’s employment.

a. Discuss the signs you expect for each of the coefficients.

b. Explain why this supply equation cannot be consistently estimated by OLS regression.

c. Suppose we consider the woman’s labor‑market experience EXPER and its square, EXPER², to be instruments for WAGE. Explain how these variables satisfy the logic of instrumental variables.

d. Is the supply equation identified? Explain.

e. Describe the steps [not a computer command] you would take to obtain IV/2SLS estimates.

### ANS.

Model Specification

We consider the following labor supply model for married women:

$$
HOURS = \beta_1 + \beta_2 WAGE + \beta_3 EDUC + \beta_4 AGE + \beta_5 KIDSL6 + \beta_6 NWIFEINC + e
$$

Where:
- **HOURS**: hours worked per week (labor supply)
- **WAGE**: hourly wage
- **EDUC**: years of education
- **AGE**: age
- **KIDSL6**: number of children under 6 years old in the household
- **NWIFEINC**: non-wife household income (i.e., household income excluding the wife’s earnings)
- **e**: error term


**(a)** Expected Signs of the Coefficients

| Variable | Expected Sign | Explanation |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| β2  (WAGE) |   +   | Higher wages increase the incentive to work (substitution effect) |
| β3  (EDUC) |   +   | More education often leads to better job opportunities and willingness to work |
| β4  (AGE)  |   ±   | Age may increase experience but also reflect retirement or childcare stage |
| β5  (KIDSL6) |   -   | Young children increase time constraints, reducing labor supply |
| β6  (NWIFEINC) |   -   | Higher non-wife income reduces the need to work (income effect) |

**(b)**  Why OLS Cannot Provide Consistent Estimates

The key issue is that **WAGE** is likely **endogenous**, meaning:

- Unobserved factors (e.g., ability or motivation) affect both WAGE and HOURS
- Reverse causality: working more could lead to higher wage estimates

Hence, the OLS assumption:

$$
\text{Cov}(WAGE, e) = 0
$$

is violated.

🔴 This leads to **biased and inconsistent OLS estimates**.

**(c)**  Why EXPER and EXPER² Can Be Used as Instruments for WAGE

To be valid instruments, EXPER and EXPER² must satisfy:

| Condition | Satisfied? | Explanation |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Relevance** | ✅ Yes | Experience is strongly correlated with wages |
| **Exogeneity** | ✅ Reasonable | Experience affects HOURS only indirectly through WAGE |

🟢 Thus, EXPER and EXPER² are **plausible instruments** for WAGE.

**(d)**  Is the Model Identified?

- One endogenous regressor: **WAGE**
- Two instruments: **EXPER**, **EXPER²**

Definition:

A model is said to be identified when the number of instruments ≥ the number of endogenous variables.
The model is then considered either just-identified or overidentified.

In this case:

1 endogenous variable

2 instruments

➡️ The model is overidentified

➡️ ✅ It is identified, and we can test the validity of the instruments (e.g., Sargan test)

**(e)**  Steps to Obtain IV / 2SLS Estimates (Non-Computational)

Step 1️⃣: First Stage Regression

Regress the endogenous variable **WAGE** on the instruments:

$$
WAGE = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \cdot EXPER + \gamma_2 \cdot EXPER^2 + \text{controls} + v
$$

Obtain the fitted values $\widehat{WAGE}$ from this regression.


Step 2️⃣: Second Stage Regression

Replace **WAGE** with $\widehat{WAGE}$ in the original model and estimate using OLS:

$$
HOURS = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \cdot \widehat{WAGE} + \beta_3 \cdot EDUC + \beta_4 \cdot AGE + \beta_5 \cdot KIDSL6 + \beta_6 \cdot NWIFEINC + u
$$

The resulting estimate $\hat{\beta}_2$ is the **IV / 2SLS estimate** for the causal effect of WAGE on HOURS.
