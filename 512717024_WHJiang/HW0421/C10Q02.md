## (a) Expected Signs of the Coefficients

| Variable | Expected Sign | Economic Intuition |
|----------|---------------|--------------------|
| **WAGE** | **+** | A higher hourly wage raises the opportunity cost of leisure (substitution effect), so hours supplied should increase. |
| **EDUC** | **+** | More schooling raises skills and career opportunities, increasing both earnings potential and the incentive to work. |
| **AGE**  | **±** | Hours may rise with age early in the life‑cycle (career building) but fall at older ages (greater taste for leisure), producing a possible inverted‑U shape. |
| **KIDSL6** | **−** | Young children require time for childcare, reducing the mother’s available market hours. |
| **NWIFEINC** | **−** | Higher non‑wife income provides additional household resources, lowering the need for the wife’s market work (pure income effect). |

## (b) Why OLS Is Inconsistent

1. **Endogeneity:**  
   Wage (**WAGE**) is jointly determined with hours and is correlated with unobserved productivity or preference shocks in the error term \(e\), so \(\operatorname{Cov}(WAGE,e)\neq0\).

2. **Simultaneity:**  
   Market wages and labor supply are simultaneously set by labor‑demand and labor‑supply forces; OLS cannot separate cause from effect, violating the exogeneity assumption \(E(e\mid X)=0\).

---

## (c) Why **EXPER** and **EXPER²** Are Valid Instruments for **WAGE**

* **Relevance:** Labor‑market experience strongly predicts the wage rate, and including the square term captures diminishing returns; hence \(\operatorname{Cov}(EXPER,WAGE)\neq0\).

* **Exogeneity:** After controlling for education, age, young children, and other income, cumulative past experience should not directly affect current taste for leisure or other unobservables in \(e\), giving \(\operatorname{Cov}(EXPER,e)=0\).

Because both relevance and exogeneity conditions hold, **EXPER** and **EXPER²** satisfy the logic of instrumental variables.

---

## (d) Identification of the Supply Equation

* **Endogenous regressor:** 1 (**WAGE**)  
* **Instruments:** 2 (**EXPER**, **EXPER²**)  
* **Order condition:** #Instruments ≥ #Endogenous ⇒ 2 ≥ 1 ✓  
* **Rank condition:** Holds if experience significantly explains wage in the first stage.

Hence the model is **over‑identified** and can be consistently estimated by IV/2SLS.

## (e) Steps to Obtain IV/2SLS Estimates (Conceptual Outline)

1. **First Stage**  
   Regress **WAGE** on all instruments and exogenous variables  
   \(Z = \{EXPER, EXPER^{2}, EDUC, AGE, KIDSL6, NWIFEINC\}\)  
   to obtain the fitted values \(\widehat{WAGE}\).

2. **Instrument Strength Check**  
   Examine the first‑stage F‑statistic; a value > 10 indicates strong instruments.

3. **Second Stage**  
   Replace **WAGE** with \(\widehat{WAGE}\) and run OLS on  
   \[
     HOURS = \beta_{1} + \beta_{2}\widehat{WAGE} + \beta_{3}EDUC + \beta_{4}AGE
           + \beta_{5}KIDSL6 + \beta_{6}NWIFEINC + u,
   \]  
   yielding the 2SLS coefficient estimates.

4. **Correct Standard Errors**  
   Use IV‑robust (heteroskedasticity‑consistent) standard errors such as White or Newey–West.

5. **Diagnostic Tests**  
   * **Over‑identification (Sargan/Hansen J‑test)** to assess instrument exogeneity.  
   * **Weak‑instrument tests** (e.g., Stock–Yogo critical values).  
   * **Endogeneity test** (Durbin–Wu–Hausman) comparing OLS vs 2SLS estimates.
