## C10Q02

The labor supply of married women has been a subject of a great deal of economic research. Consider the following supply‑equation specification

HOURS=𝛽1+𝛽2WAGE+𝛽3EDUC+𝛽4AGE+𝛽5KIDSL6+𝛽6NWIFEINC+𝑒

where HOURS is the supply of labor, WAGE is hourly wage, EDUC is years of education, KIDSL6 is the number of children in the household who are less than 6 years old, and NWIFEINC is household income from sources other than the wife’s employment.

a. Discuss the signs you expect for each of the coefficients.

b. Explain why this supply equation cannot be consistently estimated by OLS regression.

c. Suppose we consider the woman’s labor‑market experience EXPER and its square, EXPER², to be instruments for WAGE. Explain how these variables satisfy the logic of instrumental variables.

d. Is the supply equation identified? Explain.

e. Describe the steps [not a computer command] you would take to obtain IV/2SLS estimates.

### ANS.

**(a)** Expected Signs of the Coefficients

| Variable | Expected Sign | Economic Intuition |
|----------|---------------|--------------------|
| **WAGE** | **+** | A higher hourly wage raises the opportunity cost of leisure (substitution effect), so hours supplied should increase. |
| **EDUC** | **+** | More schooling raises skills and career opportunities, increasing both earnings potential and the incentive to work. |
| **AGE**  | **±** | Hours may rise with age early in the life‑cycle (career building) but fall at older ages (greater taste for leisure), producing a possible inverted‑U shape. |
| **KIDSL6** | **−** | Young children require time for childcare, reducing the mother’s available market hours. |
| **NWIFEINC** | **−** | Higher non‑wife income provides additional household resources, lowering the need for the wife’s market work (pure income effect). |

**(b)** Why OLS Is Inconsistent

1. **Endogeneity:**  
   Wage (**WAGE**) is jointly determined with hours and is correlated with unobserved productivity or preference shocks in the error term \(e\), so Cov(𝑊𝐴𝐺𝐸,𝑒)≠0


2. **Simultaneity:**  
   Market wages and labor supply are simultaneously set by labor‑demand and labor‑supply forces; OLS cannot separate cause from effect, violating the exogeneity assumption
𝐸(𝑒 ∣ 𝑋)=0

---

**(c)** Why **EXPER** and **EXPER²** Are Valid Instruments for **WAGE**

* **Relevance:** Labor‑market experience strongly predicts the wage rate, and including the square term captures diminishing returns; hence  Cov(𝐸𝑋𝑃𝐸𝑅,𝑒)=0

* **Exogeneity:** After controlling for education, age, young children, and other income, cumulative past experience should not directly affect current taste for leisure or other unobservables in \(e\), giving  Cov(𝐸𝑋𝑃𝐸𝑅,𝑒)=0.

Because both relevance and exogeneity conditions hold, **EXPER** and **EXPER²** satisfy the logic of instrumental variables.

---

**(d)** Identification of the Supply Equation

* **Endogenous regressor:** 1 (**WAGE**)  
* **Instruments:** 2 (**EXPER**, **EXPER²**)  
* **Order condition:** #Instruments ≥ #Endogenous ⇒ 2 ≥ 1 ✓  
* **Rank condition:** Holds if experience significantly explains wage in the first stage.

Hence the model is **over‑identified** and can be consistently estimated by IV/2SLS.

**(e)** Steps to Obtain IV/2SLS Estimates (Conceptual Outline)

1. **First Stage**  
   Regress **WAGE** on all instruments and exogenous variables  
   \(Z = \{EXPER, EXPER^{2}, EDUC, AGE, KIDSL6, NWIFEINC\}\)  
   to obtain the fitted values \(\widehat{WAGE}\).

2. **Instrument Strength Check**  
   Examine the first‑stage F‑statistic; a value > 10 indicates strong instruments.

3. **Second Stage**  
   Replace **WAGE** with \(\widehat{WAGE}\) and run OLS on  
   \[
     HOURS = \beta_{1} + \beta_{2}\widehat{WAGE} + \beta_{3}EDUC + \beta_{4}AGE
           + \beta_{5}KIDSL6 + \beta_{6}NWIFEINC + u,
   \]  
   yielding the 2SLS coefficient estimates.

4. **Correct Standard Errors**  
   Use IV‑robust (heteroskedasticity‑consistent) standard errors such as White or Newey–West.

5. **Diagnostic Tests**  
   * **Over‑identification (Sargan/Hansen J‑test)** to assess instrument exogeneity.  
   * **Weak‑instrument tests** (e.g., Stock–Yogo critical values).  
   * **Endogeneity test** (Durbin–Wu–Hausman) comparing OLS vs 2SLS estimates.
