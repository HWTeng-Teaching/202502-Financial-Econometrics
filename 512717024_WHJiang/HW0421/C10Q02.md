## C10Q02

The labor supply of married women has been a subject of a great deal of economic research.¬†Consider the following supply‚Äëequation specification

HOURS=ùõΩ1+ùõΩ2WAGE+ùõΩ3EDUC+ùõΩ4AGE+ùõΩ5KIDSL6+ùõΩ6NWIFEINC+ùëí

where HOURS is the supply of labor, WAGE is hourly wage, EDUC is years of education, KIDSL6 is the number of children in the household who are less than 6¬†years old, and NWIFEINC is household income from sources other than the wife‚Äôs employment.

a.¬†Discuss the signs you expect for each of the coefficients.

b.¬†Explain why this supply equation cannot be consistently estimated by OLS regression.

c.¬†Suppose we consider the woman‚Äôs labor‚Äëmarket experience EXPER and its square, EXPER¬≤, to be instruments for WAGE.¬†Explain how these variables satisfy the logic of instrumental variables.

### ANS.

Model Specification

We consider the following labor supply model for married women:

$$
HOURS = \beta_1 + \beta_2 WAGE + \beta_3 EDUC + \beta_4 AGE + \beta_5 KIDSL6 + \beta_6 NWIFEINC + e
$$

Where:
- **HOURS**: hours worked per week (labor supply)
- **WAGE**: hourly wage
- **EDUC**: years of education
- **AGE**: age
- **KIDSL6**: number of children under 6 years old in the household
- **NWIFEINC**: non-wife household income (i.e., household income excluding the wife‚Äôs earnings)
- **e**: error term


**(a)** Expected Signs of the Coefficients

| Variable | Expected Sign | Explanation |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| $ \beta_2 $ (WAGE) | $ + $ | Higher wages increase the incentive to work (substitution effect) |
| $ \beta_3 $ (EDUC) | $ + $ | More education often leads to better job opportunities and willingness to work |
| $ \beta_4 $ (AGE) | $ \pm $ | Age may increase experience but also reflect retirement or childcare stage |
| $ \beta_5 $ (KIDSL6) | $ - $ | Young children increase time constraints, reducing labor supply |
| $ \beta_6 $ (NWIFEINC) | $ - $ | Higher non-wife income reduces the need to work (income effect) |



**(b)**  Why OLS Cannot Provide Consistent Estimates

The key issue is that **WAGE** is likely **endogenous**, meaning:

- Unobserved factors (e.g., ability or motivation) affect both WAGE and HOURS
- Reverse causality: working more could lead to higher wage estimates

Hence, the OLS assumption:

$$
\text{Cov}(WAGE, e) = 0
$$

is violated.

üî¥ This leads to **biased and inconsistent OLS estimates**.


**(c)**  Why EXPER and EXPER¬≤ Can Be Used as Instruments for WAGE

To be valid instruments, EXPER and EXPER¬≤ must satisfy:

| Condition | Satisfied? | Explanation |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Relevance** | ‚úÖ Yes | Experience is strongly correlated with wages |
| **Exogeneity** | ‚úÖ Reasonable | Experience affects HOURS only indirectly through WAGE |

üü¢ Thus, EXPER and EXPER¬≤ are **plausible instruments** for WAGE.



**(d)**  Is the Model Identified?

- One endogenous regressor: **WAGE**
- Two instruments: **EXPER**, **EXPER¬≤**

Since:

$$
\# \text{instruments} > \# \text{endogenous variables}
$$

‚û°Ô∏è The model is **overidentified**, hence **identified**.

This allows us to test for instrument validity (e.g., with a Sargan test).



**(e)**  Steps to Obtain IV / 2SLS Estimates (Non-Computational)

Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: First Stage Regression

Regress the endogenous variable **WAGE** on the instruments:

$$
WAGE = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \cdot EXPER + \gamma_2 \cdot EXPER^2 + \text{controls} + v
$$

Obtain the fitted values $\widehat{WAGE}$ from this regression.



Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Second Stage Regression

Replace **WAGE** with $\widehat{WAGE}$ in the original model and estimate using OLS:

$$
HOURS = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \cdot \widehat{WAGE} + \beta_3 \cdot EDUC + \beta_4 \cdot AGE + \beta_5 \cdot KIDSL6 + \beta_6 \cdot NWIFEINC + u
$$

The resulting estimate $\hat{\beta}_2$ is the **IV / 2SLS estimate** for the causal effect of WAGE on HOURS.
