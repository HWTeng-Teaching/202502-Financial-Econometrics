### C10Q18

Consider the data file mroz on working wives. Use the 428 observations on married women who participate in the labor force. In this exercise, we examine the effectiveness of a parent’s college education as an instrumental variable.

a. Create two new variables. MOTHERCOLL is a dummy variable equaling one if MOTHEREDUC > 12, zero otherwise. Similarly, FATHERCOLL equals one if FATHEREDUC > 12 and zero otherwise. What percentage of parents have some college education in this sample?

b. Find the correlations between EDUC, MOTHERCOLL, and FATHERCOLL. Are the magnitudes of these correlations important? Can you make a logical argument why MOTHERCOLL and FATHERCOLL might be better instruments than MOTHEREDUC and FATHEREDUC?

c. Estimate the wage equation in Example 10.5 using MOTHERCOLL as the instrumental variable. What is the 95% interval estimate for the coefficient of EDUC?

d. For the problem in part (c), estimate the first-stage equation. What is the value of the F-test statistic for the hypothesis that MOTHERCOLL has no effect on EDUC? Is MOTHERCOLL a strong instrument?

e. Estimate the wage equation in Example 10.5 using MOTHERCOLL and FATHERCOLL as the instrumental variables. What is the 95% interval estimate for the coefficient of EDUC? Is it narrower or wider than the one in part (c)?

f. For the problem in part (e), estimate the first-stage equation. Test the joint significance of MOTHERCOLL and FATHERCOLL. Do these instruments seem adequately strong?

g. For the IV estimation in part (e), test the validity of the surplus instrument. What do you conclude?

# Instrumental Variables Analysis Results

## (a) Proportion with Some College
- **Mothers:** 12.15 %  
- **Fathers:** 11.68 %

## (b) Correlations
| Pair                       | ρ     |
|----------------------------|-------|
| EDUC – MOTHERCOLL          | 0.359 |
| EDUC – FATHERCOLL          | 0.398 |
| MOTHERCOLL – FATHERCOLL    | 0.355 |

Parents who have attended college are likely to place greater importance on their children's education compared to those who have not attended college.

These moderate correlation coefficients indicate that the instrumental variables exhibit relevance, but are not perfectly collinear.

Using dummy variables such as "whether attended college" helps reduce measurement error and aligns with the assumption that having attended college has a more significant effect than years of education.

## (c) 2SLS with MOTHERCOLL as the Sole Instrument
- \(\displaystyle \hat\beta_{\mathrm{EDUC}} = 0.0760\)  
- \(SE = 0.042\)  
- 95 % CI = \([−0.006,\;0.158]\)

## (d) First-Stage F-Statistic
- \(F = 63.56\) (p < 0.001) ⇒ strong instrument

## (e) 2SLS with MOTHERCOLL & FATHERCOLL
- \(\displaystyle \hat\beta_{\mathrm{EDUC}} = 0.0878\)  
- \(SE = 0.032\)  
- 95 % CI = \([0.024,\;0.151]\)

> The interval is narrower than in part (c), reflecting higher efficiency.

## (f) Joint Strength of Both Instruments
**First-stage test**  
\(H_0: \pi_1 = \pi_2 = 0\)

- \(F = 56.96\) (p < 0.001) ⇒ jointly strong

## (g) Over-Identification (Hansen J)
- \(J = 0.214\)  
- \(df = 1\)  
- \(p = 0.64\)

Fail to reject \(H_0\); the extra instrument (FATHERCOLL) appears valid.

---

## Summary

- College-educated parents are relatively rare (≈ 12 %).  
- Their college dummies are relevant and strong instruments for **EDUC**.  
- Using both dummies increases precision, and the over-identification test supports instrument validity.
