### C10Q20

The CAPM [see Exercises 10.14 and 2.16] says that the risk premium on security j is related to the risk premium on the market portfolio. That is

    rj − rf = αj + βj (rm − rf)

where r_j and r_f are the returns to security j and the risk‑free rate, respectively; r_m is the return on the market portfolio, and β_j is the jth security’s “beta” value. We measure the market portfolio using the Standard & Poor’s value‑weighted index, and the risk‑free rate by the 30‑day LIBOR monthly rate of return. As noted in Exercise 10.14, if the market return is measured with error, then we face an errors‑in‑variables, or measurement‑error, problem.

a. Use the observations on Microsoft in the data file capm5 to estimate the CAPM model using OLS. How would you classify the Microsoft stock over this period? Risky or relatively safe, relative to the market portfolio?

b. It has been suggested that it is possible to construct an IV by ranking the values of the explanatory variable and using the rank as the IV, that is, we sort (r_m − r_f) from smallest to largest, and assign the values RANK = 1, 2, …, 180. Does this variable potentially satisfy the conditions IV1–IV3? Create RANK and obtain the first‑stage regression results. Is the coefficient of RANK very significant? What is the R² of the first‑stage regression? Can RANK be regarded as a strong IV?

c. Compute the first‑stage residuals, v̂, and add them to the CAPM model. Estimate the resulting augmented equation by OLS and test the significance of v̂ at the 1% level of significance. Can we conclude that the market return is exogenous?

d. Use RANK as an IV and estimate the CAPM model by IV/2SLS. Compare this IV estimate to the OLS estimate in part (a). Does the IV estimate agree with your expectations?

e. Create a new variable POS = 1 if the market return (r_m − r_f) is positive, and zero otherwise. Obtain the first‑stage regression results using both RANK and POS as instrumental variables. Test the joint significance of the IV. Can we conclude that we have adequately strong IV? What is the R² of the first‑stage regression?

f. Carry out the Hausman test for endogeneity using the residuals from the first‑stage equation in (e). Can we conclude that the market return is exogenous at the 1% level of significance?

g. Obtain the IV/2SLS estimates of the CAPM model using RANK and POS as instrumental variables. Compare this IV estimate to the OLS estimate in part (a). Does the IV estimate agree with your expectations?

h. Obtain the IV/2SLS residuals from part (g) and use them (not an automatic command) to carry out the Breusch–Pagan test for heteroskedasticity at the 5% level. What do you conclude?

## Ans:
# Estimation and Diagnostic Results for Microsoft Beta

## (a) OLS Estimation

$$
r_{\text{MSFT}} - r_f = 0.0033 + 1.2018\,(r_m - r_f)
$$

- **Estimated β:** \(\beta \approx 1.20\) ⇒ Microsoft was slightly riskier than the market.  
- **\(R^2 = 0.352\)**

The 95% confidence interval for the estimate is [0.9607882, 1.442891]. Since most of the interval lies above 1, this suggests that the stock is relatively riskier compared to the market portfolio. However, note that the null hypothesis that Microsoft’s beta equals 1 cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level.

## (b) Instrument: RANK  
**First-stage regression:**  
\[
r_m - r_f = -0.0790 + 0.000907\,\text{RANK}
\]
- **t-stat:** 43.1  
- **\(R^2 = 0.913\)** ⇒ strong IV; IV relevance plausible.

---

## (c) Exogeneity Test  
Augmented regression including first-stage residual \(\hat v\):  
- **p-value:** 0.0428 > 0.01  
- **Conclusion:** Cannot reject exogeneity of \(r_m - r_f\) at the 1% level.

---

## (d) 2SLS with RANK  
- \(\displaystyle \hat\alpha_{\text{IV}} = 0.0030\)  
- \(\displaystyle \hat\beta_{\text{IV}} = 1.2783\)  
- \(\hat\beta_{\text{IV}} > \hat\beta_{\text{OLS}}\), consistent with attenuation bias from measurement error.

The 95% confidence interval is now [1.028819,1.527817]. Since all values in the interval are greater than 1, we reject the null hypothesis that Microsoft’s beta equals 1.

---

## (e) Add Second IV: POS  
- **First-stage F:** 951.3  
- **\(R^2 = 0.915\)** ⇒ instruments jointly very strong.

The F-statistic exceeds 10 and is also greater than the Stock-Yogo critical value of 19.93 based on the test size criterion. If we are willing to accept a 10% Type I error rate for a 5% significance test, we conclude that the instrument is not weak.

---

## (f) Hausman Test  
- **p-value (residual):** 0.0287 > 0.01  
- **Conclusion:** Fail to reject exogeneity at 1%.

---

## (g) 2SLS with RANK & POS  
- \(\displaystyle \hat\alpha_{\text{IV},2} = 0.0030\)  
- \(\displaystyle \hat\beta_{\text{IV},2} = 1.2831\)  
- Very close to (d); still larger than OLS as expected.

The estimated coefficient is 1.2866, which is higher than the OLS estimate reported in part (a). The 95% confidence interval is [1.037005, 1.536111], and since all values in the interval are greater than 1, we reject the null hypothesis that Microsoft’s beta equals 1 at the 5% significance level.

---

## (h) Breusch–Pagan Test for Heteroskedasticity  
\[
\chi^2(1) = 1.57,\quad p = 0.21
\]
- **Conclusion:** No evidence of heteroskedasticity at the 5% level.

Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis of IV validity. This suggests that there may be an issue with the current instrument, and a new, more appropriate IV should be identified.


---

## Summary
- Microsoft’s beta is approximately **1.20–1.28**, indicating slightly higher systematic risk than the market.  
- The instruments **RANK** and **POS** are strong and jointly relevant.  
- Hausman tests do not reject exogeneity.  
- No heteroskedasticity detected via Breusch–Pagan.  
- Overall, IV estimates confirm and refine the OLS result.
