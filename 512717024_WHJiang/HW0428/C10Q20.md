### C10Q20

The CAPM [see Exercises 10.14 and 2.16] says that the risk premium on security j is related to the risk premium on the market portfolio. That is

    rj − rf = αj + βj (rm − rf)

where r_j and r_f are the returns to security j and the risk‑free rate, respectively; r_m is the return on the market portfolio, and β_j is the jth security’s “beta” value. We measure the market portfolio using the Standard & Poor’s value‑weighted index, and the risk‑free rate by the 30‑day LIBOR monthly rate of return. As noted in Exercise 10.14, if the market return is measured with error, then we face an errors‑in‑variables, or measurement‑error, problem.

a. Use the observations on Microsoft in the data file capm5 to estimate the CAPM model using OLS. How would you classify the Microsoft stock over this period? Risky or relatively safe, relative to the market portfolio?

b. It has been suggested that it is possible to construct an IV by ranking the values of the explanatory variable and using the rank as the IV, that is, we sort (r_m − r_f) from smallest to largest, and assign the values RANK = 1, 2, …, 180. Does this variable potentially satisfy the conditions IV1–IV3? Create RANK and obtain the first‑stage regression results. Is the coefficient of RANK very significant? What is the R² of the first‑stage regression? Can RANK be regarded as a strong IV?

c. Compute the first‑stage residuals, v̂, and add them to the CAPM model. Estimate the resulting augmented equation by OLS and test the significance of v̂ at the 1% level of significance. Can we conclude that the market return is exogenous?

d. Use RANK as an IV and estimate the CAPM model by IV/2SLS. Compare this IV estimate to the OLS estimate in part (a). Does the IV estimate agree with your expectations?

e. Create a new variable POS = 1 if the market return (r_m − r_f) is positive, and zero otherwise. Obtain the first‑stage regression results using both RANK and POS as instrumental variables. Test the joint significance of the IV. Can we conclude that we have adequately strong IV? What is the R² of the first‑stage regression?

f. Carry out the Hausman test for endogeneity using the residuals from the first‑stage equation in (e). Can we conclude that the market return is exogenous at the 1% level of significance?

g. Obtain the IV/2SLS estimates of the CAPM model using RANK and POS as instrumental variables. Compare this IV estimate to the OLS estimate in part (a). Does the IV estimate agree with your expectations?

h. Obtain the IV/2SLS residuals from part (g) and use them (not an automatic command) to carry out the Breusch–Pagan test for heteroskedasticity at the 5% level. What do you conclude?
