# Instrumental Variables Analysis Results

## (a) Proportion with Some College
- **Mothers:** 12.15 %  
- **Fathers:** 11.68 %

## (b) Correlations
| Pair                       | ρ     |
|----------------------------|-------|
| EDUC – MOTHERCOLL          | 0.359 |
| EDUC – FATHERCOLL          | 0.398 |
| MOTHERCOLL – FATHERCOLL    | 0.355 |

These moderate correlations imply relevance without perfect collinearity. Using college dummies mitigates measurement error and matches the idea that “any college” matters more than each extra year.

## (c) 2SLS with MOTHERCOLL as the Sole Instrument
- \(\displaystyle \hat\beta_{\mathrm{EDUC}} = 0.0760\)  
- \(SE = 0.042\)  
- 95 % CI = \([−0.006,\;0.158]\)

## (d) First-Stage F-Statistic
- \(F = 63.56\) (p < 0.001) ⇒ strong instrument

## (e) 2SLS with MOTHERCOLL & FATHERCOLL
- \(\displaystyle \hat\beta_{\mathrm{EDUC}} = 0.0878\)  
- \(SE = 0.032\)  
- 95 % CI = \([0.024,\;0.151]\)

> The interval is narrower than in part (c), reflecting higher efficiency.

## (f) Joint Strength of Both Instruments
**First-stage test**  
\(H_0: \pi_1 = \pi_2 = 0\)

- \(F = 56.96\) (p < 0.001) ⇒ jointly strong

## (g) Over-Identification (Hansen J)
- \(J = 0.214\)  
- \(df = 1\)  
- \(p = 0.64\)

Fail to reject \(H_0\); the extra instrument (FATHERCOLL) appears valid.

---

## Summary

- College-educated parents are relatively rare (≈ 12 %).  
- Their college dummies are relevant and strong instruments for **EDUC**.  
- Using both dummies increases precision, and the over-identification test supports instrument validity.
