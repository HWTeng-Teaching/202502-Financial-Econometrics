The file wa-wheat.dat contains observations on wheat yield in Western Australian shires. There are 48 annual observations for the years 1950–1997. For the Northampton shire, consider the following four equations:

YIELD_t = β₀ + β₁ TIME + e_t

YIELD_t = α₀ + α₁ ln(TIME) + e_t

YIELD_t = γ₀ + γ₁ TIME² + e_t

ln(YIELD_t) = ϕ₀ + ϕ₁ TIME + e_t

a. Estimate each of the four equations. Taking into consideration (i) plots of the fitted equations, (ii) plots of the residuals, (iii) error normality tests, and (iv) values for R², which equation do you think is preferable? Explain.

b. Interpret the coefficient of the time-related variable in your chosen specification.

c. Using your chosen specification, identify any unusual observations, based on the studentized residuals, LEVERAGE, DFBETAS, and DFFITS.

d. Using your chosen specification, use the observations up to 1996 to estimate the model. Construct a 95% prediction interval for YIELD in 1997. Does your interval contain the true value?

The quadratic model has the highest p-value, indicating that its residuals are closest to a normal distribution and therefore best satisfy the normality assumption.The mode3 (Quadratic Model) is preferred.


**(b)**

For the quadratic model, the estimated coefficient for the squared time term is 0.0004986. Since the marginal effect is calculated as the derivative of the yield with respect to time, it equals 2×0.0004986×time. This means the slope—and thus the marginal effect—changes at each time point.

When evaluated at time = 10, 20, 30, and 40, the corresponding marginal effects on yield are approximately 0.00997, 0.01994, 0.02992, and 0.03989, respectively. These values show that the marginal effect of time on yield increases as time progresses. This suggests that, over time, the accumulated impact of technological advancements leads to greater increases in output, resulting in a rising marginal effect.

Outlier Observation Table:

The year 1963 (TIME = 14, YIELD = 0.3024) is identified as a low-yield outlier that has a significant impact on the regression results. Similarly, the year 1992 (TIME = 43, YIELD = 2.3161) stands out as an unusually high-yield point, which also greatly influences the regression coefficients.

These outliers may have been caused by extreme weather conditions, policy changes, or technological breakthroughs. Outlier detection indicates that both 1963 (low yield) and 1992 (high yield) exert substantial influence on the regression analysis.


**(d)**

We used the quadratic model to predict the yield for the year 1997, along with a 95% confidence interval.

Predicted yield for 1997: 2.2318 tons per hectare

95% Confidence Interval: [1.3724, 2.3898]

This means we are 95% confident that the actual yield in 1997 falls within this reasonable confidence range.
