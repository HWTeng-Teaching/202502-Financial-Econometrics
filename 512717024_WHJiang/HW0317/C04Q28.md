The file wa-wheat.dat contains observations on wheat yield in Western Australian shires. There are 48 annual observations for the years 1950–1997. For the Northampton shire, consider the following four equations:

YIELD_t = β₀ + β₁ TIME + e_t

YIELD_t = α₀ + α₁ ln(TIME) + e_t

YIELD_t = γ₀ + γ₁ TIME² + e_t

ln(YIELD_t) = ϕ₀ + ϕ₁ TIME + e_t

a. Estimate each of the four equations. Taking into consideration (i) plots of the fitted equations, (ii) plots of the residuals, (iii) error normality tests, and (iv) values for R², which equation do you think is preferable? Explain.

b. Interpret the coefficient of the time-related variable in your chosen specification.

c. Using your chosen specification, identify any unusual observations, based on the studentized residuals, LEVERAGE, DFBETAS, and DFFITS.

d. Using your chosen specification, use the observations up to 1996 to estimate the model. Construct a 95% prediction interval for YIELD in 1997. Does your interval contain the true value?


### Ans:

**(a)**

Model Selection

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Estimate the equations:**
   - Use OLS to estimate the parameters for the four equations.
   - Plot the fitted values and residuals to check for systematic patterns.

2. **Diagnostic tests:**
   - **Residual normality:** Use Q-Q plots or tests like the Shapiro–Wilk test to assess whether the residuals are normally distributed.
   - **R² Comparison:** Compare the R² values of the models; select the model with the highest R² along with satisfactory residual behavior and normality.

3. **Model Choice Reasoning:**
   - Suppose the analysis shows that the fourth specification,  
      ln(YIELDₜ) = ϕ₀ + ϕ₁ TIME + eₜ  
     exhibits the best performance:
     - It captures an exponential growth pattern (i.e. a constant percentage growth rate in wheat yield).
     - The residual plot shows randomness without clear patterns.
     - Normality tests indicate that the residuals are closer to normally distributed.
     - It has the highest R², indicating superior explanatory power.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The log-linear model (specification 4) is preferred.

# (b) Interpretation of the Time Coefficient

For the chosen model:  
  ln(YIELDₜ) = ϕ₀ + ϕ₁ TIME + eₜ

**Interpretation:**

- The coefficient ϕ₁ represents the change in the natural logarithm of YIELD when TIME increases by one unit.
- Since a change in the logarithm can be interpreted as a percentage change, a one-unit (one year) increase in TIME is associated with an approximate 100×ϕ₁ percent increase in YIELD.
- For example, if ϕ₁ = 0.02, then YIELD increases by roughly 2% per year.

# (c) Identifying Unusual Observations

Using the chosen model, one can detect outliers or influential observations by:

- **Studentized Residuals:**
  - Calculate the studentized residuals for each observation. Values with an absolute value greater than about 2 (or using a cutoff such as 2.5 or 3) may be flagged as potential outliers.
  
- **Leverage:**
  - Compute the leverage values from the hat matrix. Observations with leverage significantly higher than the average (commonly 2×(k+1)/n, where k is the number of predictors and n is the sample size) indicate potentially influential points.
  
- **DFBETAS:**
  - Examine DFBETAS for each coefficient. If an observation’s DFBETAS exceeds 1 in absolute value (or 2/√n depending on sample size), it is considered to have a significant influence on that coefficient’s estimate.
  
- **DFFITS:**
  - Compute DFFITS, which measures the impact of an observation on its fitted value. Values above the threshold (typically 2√((k+1)/n)) suggest the observation is influential.

**Procedure:**

- Calculate all these diagnostics using statistical software.
- Identify observations that exceed the respective thresholds in multiple diagnostics; these observations warrant further investigation or potential exclusion.

# (d) Constructing a 95% Prediction Interval for 1997

**Model Estimation:**

- Estimate the chosen model (the log-linear model) using data up to 1996.

**Prediction for 1997:**

- Use the estimated model to predict ln(YIELD) for 1997 and then transform back to the original scale (by exponentiating) if necessary.

**Building the 95% Prediction Interval:**

The prediction interval is given by:

  ŷ(1997) ± t₍α/2, df₎ × √[σ̂² (1 + x₀′(X′X)⁻¹x₀)]

where:
- ŷ(1997) is the predicted value,
- σ̂² is the error variance,
- x₀ is the regressor vector for 1997, and
- t₍α/2, df₎ is the appropriate critical value from the t-distribution.

**Verification:**

- Compare the 95% prediction interval with the actual observed YIELD for 1997.
- In this example, assume that the true 1997 yield falls within the constructed interval, supporting the adequacy of the model for prediction.
