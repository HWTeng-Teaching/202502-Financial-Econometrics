Consider a model for household expenditures as a function of household income using the 2013 data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, cex5_small. The data file cex5 contains more observations. Our attention is restricted to three-person households, consisting of a husband, a wife, plus one other. In this exercise, we examine expenditures on a staple item, food. In this extended example, you are asked to compare the linear, log-log, and linear-log specifications.

a. Calculate summary statistics for the variables: FOOD and INCOME. Report for each the sample mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. Construct histograms for both variables.

b. Estimate the linear relationship FOOD = β₁ + β₂ INCOME + e. Create a scatter plot FOOD versus INCOME and include the fitted least squares line. Construct a 95% interval estimate for β₂.

c. Obtain the least squares residuals from the regression in (b) and plot them against INCOME.

d. Calculate both a point estimate and a 95% interval estimate of the elasticity of food expenditure with respect to income at INCOME = 19, 65, and 160.

e. Estimate the log-log relationship ln(FOOD) = γ₁ + γ₂ ln(INCOME) + e. Create a scatter plot and compare it to the linear model.

f. Construct a point and 95% interval estimate of the elasticity for the log-log model.

g. Obtain the least squares residuals from the log-log model and analyze them.

h. Estimate the linear-log relationship FOOD = α₁ + α₂ ln(INCOME) + e and compare it to other models.

i. Construct a point and 95% interval estimate of the elasticity for the linear-log model.

j. Obtain the least squares residuals from the linear-log model and analyze them.

k. Based on this exercise, do you prefer the linear relationship model, or the log-log or linear-log model?

# (b) Estimating the Linear Model and β₂ Confidence Interval

## Model Estimation:
- Fit the linear model:  
  `FOOD = β₁ + β₂ INCOME + e`  
  using OLS to obtain point estimates and standard errors for β₁ and β₂.

## Scatter Plot with Fitted Line:
- Create a scatter plot of FOOD versus INCOME and overlay the OLS fitted line to visually assess the linear relationship.

## Construct the 95% Confidence Interval for β₂:
- Use the formula:
