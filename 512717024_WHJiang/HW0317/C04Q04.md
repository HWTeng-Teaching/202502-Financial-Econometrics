The general manager of a large engineering firm wants to know whether the experience of technical artists influences their work quality. A random sample of 50 artists is selected. Using years of work experience (EXPER) and a performance rating (RATING, on a 100-point scale), two models are estimated by least squares. The estimates and standard errors are as follows:

### Model 1

\[
\text{RATING} = 64.289 + 0.990 \times \text{EXPER}, \quad N = 50, \quad R^2 = 0.3793
\]

\[
(\text{se}) = (2.422) \quad (0.183)
\]

### Model 2

\[
\text{RATING} = 39.464 + 15.312 \ln(\text{EXPER}), \quad N = 46, \quad R^2 = 0.6414
\]

\[
(\text{se}) = (4.198) \quad (1.727)
\]

1. **(a)** Sketch the fitted values from Model 1 for \(\text{EXPER} = 0\) to 30 years.

2. **(b)** Sketch the fitted values from Model 2 against \(\text{EXPER} = 1\) to 30 years. Explain why the four artists with no experience are not used in the estimation of Model 2.

3. **(c)** Using Model 1, compute the marginal effect on RATING of another year of experience for (i) an artist with 10 years of experience and (ii) an artist with 20 years of experience.

4. **(d)** Using Model 2, compute the marginal effect on RATING of another year of experience for (i) an artist with 10 years of experience and (ii) an artist with 20 years of experience.

5. **(e)** Which of the two models fits the data better? Estimation of Model 1 using just the technical artists with some experience yields \( R^2 = 0.4858 \).

6. **(f)** Do you find Model 1 or Model 2 more reasonable, or plausible, based on economic reasoning? Explain.

### Ans:

### (a)
**Sketch (Model 1):** The fitted line is

\[
\widehat{RATING} = 64.289 + 0.990 \times EXP,
\]

for **EXP** ranging from 1 to 30. It is a straight line with slope 0.990.

**Reason for Excluding Zero-Experience Artists in Model 2:** Because Model 2 uses \(\ln(EXP)\), any observation with \(EXP = 0\) is undefined in the logarithm function. Hence, those four artists are not included in the regression for Model 2.

### (b)
**Sketch (Model 2):**

\[
\widehat{RATING} = 39.464 + 1.312\, \ln(EXP),
\]

plotted for \(EXP = 1\) to 30. This curve increases at a decreasing rate.

**Comparison for Large EXP:** Model 1 increases linearly, whereas Model 2 grows more slowly (logarithmically). For large values of **EXP**, Model 1 typically predicts higher ratings than Model 2.

### (c)
**Marginal Effect in Model 1:**

\[
\frac{\partial RATING}{\partial EXP} = 0.990,
\]

constant for any level of **EXP**. So at 10 or 20 years, the additional year of experience increases **RATING** by 0.990.

### (d)
**Marginal Effect in Model 2:**

\[
\frac{\partial RATING}{\partial EXP} = 15.312 \times \frac{1}{EXP}.
\]

For 10 years:
\[
15.312/10 = 1.531
\]

For 20 years:
\[
15.312/20 = 0.766
\]

Thus, Model 2 exhibits diminishing marginal returns to experience.

### (e)
**Which Model Fits Better?**  
Based on the reported \(R^2\) values (0.3793 for Model 1 vs. 0.6414 for Model 2), Model 2 provides a better fit to the data.

### (f)
**Economic Reasoning:**  
A log-linear model (Model 2) typically captures diminishing returns to experience, which is often more realistic. Although Model 2 cannot handle zero-experience observations without adjustment (e.g., using \(\ln(EXP+1)\)), its higher \(R^2\) and the theoretical plausibility of diminishing returns suggest that Model 2 is more reasonable overall.
