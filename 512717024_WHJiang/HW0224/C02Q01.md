# Question:

Consider the following five observations. You are to do all the parts of this exercise using only a calculator.

   x      y     (x - x̄)   (y - ȳ)   (x - x̄)²   (y - ȳ)²   (x - x̄)(y - ȳ)

(a) Complete the entries in the table. Put the sums in the last row. What are the sample means x̄ and ȳ?

(b) Calculate b̂1 and b̂2 using (2.7) and (2.8) and state their interpretation.

(c) Compute Σ(xᵢ − x̄)², Σ(yᵢ − ȳ)², Σ(xᵢ − x̄)(yᵢ − ȳ). Using these numerical values, show that 
   Σ(xᵢ − x̄)² = Σxᵢ² − n(x̄)², 
   and similarly for y, and that 
   Σ(xᵢ − x̄)(yᵢ − ȳ) = Σ(xᵢyᵢ) − n(x̄)(ȳ).

(d) Use these sample statistics to compute estimates of ρ, the population correlation coefficient, and β, the slope parameter of the table below. The sums in the last row. Calculate the sample variance of x, sₓ², and y, sᵧ². Show that 
   cov(x, y) = Σ(xᵢ − x̄)(yᵢ − ȳ) / (n − 1). 
   The sample covariance between x and y, sₓy, is thus. The sample correlation between x and y, rₓy = sₓy / √(sₓ² sᵧ²), and the coefficient of variation of x, CVₓ = 100(sₓ / x̄). What is the median, 50th percentile, of x?

(e) Using the sample data, plot y against x, along with the fitted regression line ŷᵢ = b̂1 + b̂2 xᵢ.

(f) Suppose we drop the outlier observation (the 5th observation, x₅, y₅). Does your fitted line pass through the remaining four sample points? Why or why not?

(g) Show that these numerical values b̂1, b̂2, sₓ², sᵧ² are Σxᵢ².

(h) Compute var(x̄) = sₓ² / n.
