# Question:

Consider the following five observations. You are to do all the parts of this exercise using only a calculator:

Obs.	x	y	x − x̄	(x − x̄)²	y − ȳ	(x − x̄)(y − ȳ)
01	3	4				
02	2	2				
03	1	3

05	0	0				
Σ	Σxi =	Σyi =	Σ(x − x̄) =	Σ(x − x̄)² =	Σ(y − ȳ) =	Σ(x − x̄)(y − ȳ) =



(a) Complete the entries in the table. Put the sums in the last row. What are the sample means x̄ and ȳ?

(b) Calculate b1 and b2 using (2.7) and (2.8) and state their interpretation.

(c) Compute Σ(xᵢ − x̄)², Σ(yᵢ − ȳ)², Σ(xᵢ − x̄)(yᵢ − ȳ). Using these numerical values, show that 
   Σ(xᵢ − x̄)² = Σxᵢ² − n(x̄)², and similarly for y, and that Σ(xᵢ − x̄)(yᵢ − ȳ) = Σ(xᵢyᵢ) − n(x̄)(ȳ).

(d) Use these sample statistics to compute estimates of ρ, the population correlation coefficient, and β, the slope parameter of the table below. The sums in the last row. Calculate the sample variance of x, sₓ², and y, sᵧ². Show that cov(x, y) = Σ(xᵢ − x̄)(yᵢ − ȳ) / (n − 1).   The sample covariance between x and y, sₓy, is thus. The sample correlation between x and y, rₓy = sₓy / √(sₓ² sᵧ²), and the coefficient of variation of x, CVₓ = 100(sₓ / x̄). What is the median, 50th percentile, of x?

[Preliminary Calculations]
Given the observations:
●	n = 5
●	Data:
 Observation 1: x = 3, y = 4
 Observation 2: x = 2, y = 2
 Observation 3: x = 1, y = 3
 Observation 4: x = -1, y = 1
 Observation 5: x = 0, y = 0
(a) Completing the Table and Finding Sample Means
1.	Calculate the sample means:
  x̄ = (3 + 2 + 1 − 1 + 0) / 5 = 5/5 = 1
  ȳ = (4 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 0) / 5 = 10/5 = 2
2.	Calculate deviations and products:
Obs.	x	y	x − x̄	(x − x̄)²	y − ȳ	(x − x̄)(y − ȳ)
01	3	4	2	4	2	4
02	2	2	1	1	0	0
03	1	3	0	0	1	0
04	-1	1	-2	4	-1	2
05	0	0	-1	1	-2	2
Σ	Σxi
= 5	Σyi
= 10	Σ(x − x̄)
= 0	Σ(x − x̄)²
= 10	Σ(y − ȳ)
= 0	Σ(x − x̄)(y − ȳ)
= 8
Answer (a):
●	Sample means: x̄ = 1, ȳ = 2
●	Completed table is as shown above.

(b) Calculating b₁ and b₂ and Their Interpretation
Using the formulas for simple linear regression:
●	b₂ = Σ(x − x̄)(y − ȳ) / Σ(x − x̄)² = 8 / 10 = 0.8
●	b₁ = ȳ − b₂•x̄ = 2 − 0.8×1 = 1.2
Interpretation:
●	b₂ (slope) means that for every one-unit increase in x, y is expected to increase by 0.8 on average.
●	b₁ (intercept) indicates that when x = 0, the predicted value of y is 1.2.

(c) Verifying the Formulas
1.	For x:
  Σ(x − x̄)² is computed as 10.
  Now, Σx² = 3² + 2² + 1² + (−1)² + 0² = 9 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 15
  n(x̄)² = 5 × (1)² = 5
  Thus, 15 − 5 = 10, which verifies that Σ(x − x̄)² = Σx² − n(x̄)².
2.	For y:
  Σy² = 4² + 2² + 3² + 1² + 0² = 16 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 0 = 30
  n(ȳ)² = 5 × (2²) = 20
  30 − 20 = 10, verifying Σ(y − ȳ)² = Σy² − n(ȳ)².
3.	For the cross-product:
  Σ(xᵢyᵢ) = (3×4) + (2×2) + (1×3) + ((−1)×1) + (0×0) = 12 + 4 + 3 − 1 + 0 = 18
  n(x̄)(ȳ) = 5 × (1×2) = 10
  Thus, Σ(x − x̄)(y − ȳ) = 18 − 10 = 8.

(d) Calculating Sample Variances, Covariance, Correlation, and CV; Finding the Median of x
1.	Sample variances:
  sₓ² = Σ(x − x̄)² / (n − 1) = 10/4 = 2.5
  sᵧ² = 10/4 = 2.5
2.	Sample standard deviations:
  sₓ = √2.5 ≈ 1.5811
  sᵧ = √2.5 ≈ 1.5811
3.	Sample covariance:
  sₓᵧ = Σ(x − x̄)(y − ȳ) / (n − 1) = 8/4 = 2
4.	Sample correlation:
  rₓy = sₓᵧ / √(sₓ²•sᵧ²) = 2 / 2.5 = 0.8
5.	Coefficient of variation for x:
  CVₓ = 100 × (sₓ / x̄) = 100 × (1.5811 / 1) ≈ 158.11%
6.	Median of x:
  Ordering x: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 → Median = 1
Additionally, filling in the regression prediction table:
Using ŷ = 1.2 + 0.8x, compute for each observation:


xi
yi
yi^	ei^
ei^2	xiei

3	4	3.6	0.4	0.16	1.2
2	2	2.8	-0.8	0.64	-1.6
1	3	2	1	1	1
-1	1	0.4	0.6	0.36	-0.6
0	0	1.2	-1.2	1.44	0
∑xi = 5	∑yi = 10	∑ yi^ = 10	∑ ei^ = 0	∑ ei^2 = 3.6	∑ xiei = 0

(e) Plotting y against x with the Fitted Regression Line
●	Scatter data: (3,4), (2,2), (1,3), (−1,1), (0,0)
●	Regression line: ŷ = 1.2 + 0.8x
A plot can be generated (e.g., using Python/matplotlib or any other tool) with x-axis ranging from -1 to 3. The regression line will pass through the point (x̄, ȳ) = (1,2) and have a slope of 0.8.

(f) Effect of Dropping the Outlier
If the 5th observation (x₅ = 0, y₅ = 0) is dropped:
●	The sample statistics (means, variances, etc.) will change.
●	The regression line fitted using all 5 observations is derived by minimizing the sum of squared errors for the full dataset. It only necessarily passes through the point (x̄, ȳ) of the full sample.
●	Therefore, when the outlier is removed, the remaining four points generally will not lie exactly on the originally fitted line.
Answer: No, the fitted line from all observations does not pass exactly through the remaining four points because the line minimizes the overall error for the full dataset, not an exact interpolation of each remaining point.

(g) Consistency Check of Numerical Values
As shown in (c), we have verified that:   Σ(x − x̄)² = Σx² − n(x̄)².
Using this relationship, we compute sₓ² = Σ(x − x̄)²/(n−1) and b̂₂ = Σ(x − x̄)(y − ȳ)/Σ(x − x̄)².
The computed values (b̂₁ = 1.2, b̂₂ = 0.8, sₓ² = 2.5, sᵧ² = 2.5) are consistent with these formulas.

(h) Computing var(x̄)
  var(x̄) = sₓ² / n = 2.5 / 5 = 0.5
