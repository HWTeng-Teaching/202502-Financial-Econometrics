Consider the regression model:

WAGE = β₁ + β₂ EDUC + e

where WAGE is the hourly wage rate in U.S. 2013 dollars and EDUC is years of education (or schooling). The regression model is estimated twice using the least squares estimator, once for individuals from an urban area and again for individuals in a rural area.

### Urban 
WAGE = -10.76 + 2.46 EDUC,   N = 986  
(se)       (2.27)    (0.16)

### Rural
WAGE = -4.88 + 1.80 EDUC,   N = 214  
(se)       (3.29)    (0.24)

## Questions:

**(a)** Using the estimated rural regression, compute the elasticity of wages with respect to education at the “point of the means.” The sample mean of WAGE is $19.74.

**(b)** The sample mean of EDUC in the urban area is 13.68 years. Using the estimated urban regression, compute the standard error of the elasticity of wages with respect to education at the “point of the means.” Assume that the mean values are “givens” and not random.

**(c)** What is the predicted wage for an individual with 12 years of education in each area? With 16 years of education?

## Answers:
**(a)** Elasticity for the Rural Regression

The elasticity of wages with respect to education at the point of the means is given by:  
  Elasticity = β₂ × (mean EDUC / mean WAGE).

For the rural regression:
- **β₂ = 1.80**
- The mean wage is given as **19.74**.

Since the regression line passes through the means:  
  Mean EDUC = (mean WAGE – β₁) / β₂ = (19.74 + 4.88) / 1.80 = 24.62 / 1.80 ≈ **13.68**.

Thus, the elasticity is:  
  Elasticity = 1.80 × (13.68 / 19.74) ≈ 1.80 × 0.693 ≈ **1.25**.

**(b)** Standard Error of the Elasticity for the Urban Regression

For the urban regression:
- **β₂ = 2.46**, with SE(β₂) = **0.16**
- The mean EDUC is **13.68**.

The mean wage is computed as:  
  Mean WAGE = β₁ + β₂ × (mean EDUC) = -10.76 + 2.46 × 13.68 ≈ **22.89**.

The elasticity is:  
  Elasticity = 2.46 × (13.68 / 22.89) ≈ **1.47**.

Since the mean values are non-random, the standard error of the elasticity is:  
  SE(Elasticity) = (mean EDUC / mean WAGE) × SE(β₂)  
           = (13.68 / 22.89) × 0.16 ≈ 0.597 × 0.16 ≈ **0.096**.

---

**(c)** Predicted Wages for 12 and 16 Years of Education

Using the prediction equation:  
  WAGE = β₁ + β₂ × EDUC

### Urban Regression
- **For 12 years:**  
  Predicted wage = -10.76 + 2.46 × 12  
          = -10.76 + 29.52 = **18.76**

- **For 16 years:**  
  Predicted wage = -10.76 + 2.46 × 16  
          = -10.76 + 39.36 = **28.60**

### Rural Regression
- **For 12 years:**  
  Predicted wage = -4.88 + 1.80 × 12  
          = -4.88 + 21.60 = **16.72**

- **For 16 years:**  
  Predicted wage = -4.88 + 1.80 × 16  
          = -4.88 + 28.80 = **23.92**

## Final Answers

- **(a)** The elasticity of wages with respect to education in the rural area is approximately **1.25**.
- **(b)** The standard error of the elasticity in the urban area is approximately **0.096**.
- **(c) Predicted Wages:**
