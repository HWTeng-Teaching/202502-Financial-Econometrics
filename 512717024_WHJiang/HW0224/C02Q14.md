Consider the regression model:

WAGE = β₁ + β₂ EDUC + e

where WAGE is the hourly wage rate in U.S. 2013 dollars and EDUC is years of education (or schooling). The regression model is estimated twice using the least squares estimator, once for individuals from an urban area and again for individuals in a rural area.

## Urban
WAGE = -10.76 + 2.46 EDUC,   N = 986  
(se)       (2.27)    (0.16)

## Rural
WAGE = -4.88 + 1.80 EDUC,   N = 214  
(se)       (3.29)    (0.24)

*** (a) *** Using the estimated rural regression, compute the elasticity of wages with respect to education at the “point of the means.” The sample mean of WAGE is $19.74.

*** (b) *** The sample mean of EDUC in the urban area is 13.68 years. Using the estimated urban regression, compute the standard error of the elasticity of wages with respect to education at the “point of the means.” Assume that the mean values are “givens” and not random.

*** (c) *** What is the predicted wage for an individual with 12 years of education in each area? With 16 years of education?
