The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is an important model in the field of finance. It explains variations in the rate of return on a security as a function of the rate of return on a portfolio consisting of all publicly traded stocks, which is called the *market portfolio*. Generally, the rate of return on any investment is measured relative to its opportunity cost, which is the return on a risk-free asset. The resulting difference is called the *risk premium*, since it is the reward or punishment for making a risky investment. The CAPM says that the risk premium in security *j* is *proportional* to the risk premium on the market portfolio. That is:

$$
r_{j} - r_f = \beta_j (r_m - r_f)
$$

where rj and rf are the returns to security *j* and the risk-free rate, respectively, rm is the return on the market portfolio, and βj is the *beta* value. A stock’s *beta* is important to investors since it reveals the stock’s volatility. It measures the sensitivity of security *j*’s return to variation in the whole stock market. As such, values of *beta* less than one indicate that the stock is “defensive” since its variation is less than the market’s. A *beta* greater than one indicates an “aggressive stock.” Investors usually want an estimate of a stock’s *beta* before purchasing it. The CAPM model shown above is the *economic model* in this case. The *econometric model* is obtained by including an intercept in the model (even though theory says it should be zero) and an error term:

$$
r_{jm} = \alpha_j + \beta_j (r_m - r_f) + e_j
$$

## Questions:
**(a)**
Explain why the econometric model above is a simple regression model like those discussed in this chapter.

**(b)**
In the data file *capm5* are data on the monthly returns of six firms (GE, IBM, Ford, Microsoft, Disney, and Exxon-Mobil), the rate of return on the market portfolio (*MKT*), and the rate of return on the risk-free asset (*RISKFREE*). The 180 observations cover January 1998 to December 2012. Estimate the CAPM model for each firm, and comment on their estimated *beta* values. Which firm appears most aggressive? Which firm appears most defensive?

**(c)**
Finance theory says that the intercept parameter α_j should be zero. Does this seem correct given your estimates? For the Microsoft stock, plot the fitted regression line along with the data scatter.

**(d)**
Estimate the model for each firm under the assumption that α_j = 0. Do the estimates of the *beta* values change much?

## Answers:

**(a)** 
1. Model form:
   The CAPM econometric version can be written as
   r_{jm} = α_j + β_j (r_m - r_f) + e_j,
   where r_{jm} (the excess return on the stock) is the dependent variable, (r_m - r_f) (the market’s excess return) is the single explanatory variable, α_j is the intercept, β_j is the slope, and e_j is the error term. This matches the form of a simple linear regression y = β_0 + β_1 x + ε.

2. Number of parameters:
   Only two parameters (α_j and β_j) are estimated, just like in simple linear regression.

3. Error term assumption:
   We assume the error term e_j has a mean of zero and is uncorrelated with the regressor (r_m - r_f), consistent with standard linear regression assumptions.

### Conclusion

From the table above, the beta values for each stock are as follows:

- **GE**: beta ~ 1.148
- **IBM**: beta ~ 0.977
- **FORD**: beta ~ 1.662
- **MSFT**: beta ~ 1.202
- **DIS**: beta ~ 1.012
- **XOM**: beta ~ 0.457

A beta greater than 1 indicates that the stock is more sensitive to market fluctuations and is considered more "aggressive"; whereas a beta less than 1 suggests it is more "defensive".

It can be observed that:

- **FORD, GE, and MSFT** have beta values greater than 1, indicating a more aggressive stance, with **FORD (beta ~ 1.662)** being the most aggressive.
- **IBM, DIS, and XOM** have beta values less than 1, categorizing them as more defensive, with **XOM (beta ~ 0.457)** being the most defensive.


**(c)**
Regress r_{jm} on (r_m - r_f), discuss beta estimates, and identify aggressive vs. defensive stocks
1. Regression setup:
   For each stock j, estimate r_{jm} = α_j + β_j (r_m - r_f) + e_j.
2. Interpretation of β_j:
   - β_j > 1: The stock is “aggressive,” more sensitive to market movements, implying higher risk and potentially higher expected return.
   - β_j < 1: The stock is “defensive,” less sensitive to market movements, implying lower risk and potentially lower expected return.

**(d)**

1. Theoretical expectation:
   CAPM suggests α_j = 0.
2. Practical findings:
   - If α_j is near zero and not significant, it aligns with CAPM.
   - If α_j is significantly above zero, the stock may have positive abnormal returns.
   - If α_j is significantly below zero, the stock may have negative abnormal returns.
3. Statistical test:
   Use a t-test to determine whether α_j is significantly different from zero.

**(e)**

1. Microsoft’s β:
   - Large tech firms sometimes have β > 1, but it depends on actual estimates.
2. Comparison:
   - Ford, for example, might have a higher beta due to cyclical factors.
   - GE, IBM, and Disney each have distinct risk profiles.

**(f)**

1. Modified model:
   r_{jm} = β_j (r_m - r_f) + e_j.
2. Effect on β_j:
   - If α_j was originally close to zero, forcing α_j = 0 will not change β_j much.
   - If α_j was significantly different from zero, β_j may shift notably.
3. Interpretation:
   - If there is little difference in β_j between the two models, the CAPM assumption α_j = 0 is roughly valid.
   - A large difference indicates a departure from the pure CAPM assumption.
