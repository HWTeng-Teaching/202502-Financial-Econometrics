The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is an important model in the field of finance. It explains variations in the rate of return on a security as a function of the rate of return on a portfolio consisting of all publicly traded stocks, which is called the *market portfolio*. Generally, the rate of return on any investment is measured relative to its opportunity cost, which is the return on a risk-free asset. The resulting difference is called the *risk premium*, since it is the reward or punishment for making a risky investment. The CAPM says that the risk premium in security *j* is *proportional* to the risk premium on the market portfolio. That is:

$$
r_{j} - r_f = \beta_j (r_m - r_f)
$$

where rj and rf are the returns to security *j* and the risk-free rate, respectively, rm is the return on the market portfolio, and βj is the *beta* value. A stock’s *beta* is important to investors since it reveals the stock’s volatility. It measures the sensitivity of security *j*’s return to variation in the whole stock market. As such, values of *beta* less than one indicate that the stock is “defensive” since its variation is less than the market’s. A *beta* greater than one indicates an “aggressive stock.” Investors usually want an estimate of a stock’s *beta* before purchasing it. The CAPM model shown above is the *economic model* in this case. The *econometric model* is obtained by including an intercept in the model (even though theory says it should be zero) and an error term:

$$
r_{j} = \alpha_j + \beta_j (r_m - r_f) + e_j
$$

## Questions:
**(a)**
Explain why the econometric model above is a simple regression model like those discussed in this chapter.

**(b)**
In the data file *capm5* are data on the monthly returns of six firms (GE, IBM, Ford, Microsoft, Disney, and Exxon-Mobil), the rate of return on the market portfolio (*MKT*), and the rate of return on the risk-free asset (*RISKFREE*). The 180 observations cover January 1998 to December 2012. Estimate the CAPM model for each firm, and comment on their estimated *beta* values. Which firm appears most aggressive? Which firm appears most defensive?

**(c)**
Finance theory says that the intercept parameter αj should be zero. Does this seem correct given your estimates? For the Microsoft stock, plot the fitted regression line along with the data scatter.

**(d)**
Estimate the model for each firm under the assumption that αj = 0. Do the estimates of the *beta* values change much?

## Answers:

**(a)** 
The CAPM econometric version can be written as

$$
r_{j} - r_f = \beta_j (r_m - r_f)
$$
->
$$
r_{j} = \alpha_j + \beta_j (r_m - r_f) + e_j
$$

where we define

$$
y = r_j - r_f \quad \text{and} \quad x = r_m - r_f
$$

The original CAPM econometric model and by substituting the definitions above, we can rewrite the model as:
:

$$
y  = \alpha_j + \beta_j x + e_j
$$

then

$$
y = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x + e,
$$

with the identifications

$$
\beta_1 = \alpha_j \quad \text{and} \quad \beta_2 = \beta_j.
$$

Since this formulation involves only one independent variable x and one dependent variable y, it qualifies as a simple regression model.

### Conclusion
From the table above, the beta values for each stock are as follows:
- **GE**: beta ~ 1.148
- **IBM**: beta ~ 0.977
- **FORD**: beta ~ 1.662
- **MSFT**: beta ~ 1.202
- **DIS**: beta ~ 1.012
- **XOM**: beta ~ 0.457

A beta greater than 1 indicates that the stock is more sensitive to market fluctuations and is considered more "aggressive"; whereas a beta less than 1 suggests it is more "defensive".

It can be observed that:

- **FORD, GE, and MSFT** have beta values greater than 1, indicating a more aggressive stance, with **FORD (beta ~ 1.662)** being the most aggressive.
- **IBM, DIS, and XOM** have beta values less than 1, categorizing them as more defensive, with **XOM (beta ~ 0.457)** being the most defensive.

| IBM.mkt_excess       | 0.9768898         | 0.9843954      |
| FORD.mkt_excess      | 1.6620307         | 1.6667168      |

| DIS.mkt_excess       | 1.0115207         | 1.0128190      |
| XOM.mkt_excess       | 0.4565208         | 0.4630727      |

*The restriction αj = 0 has led to small changes in the βj ; but it has not changed the aggressive 
or defensive nature of the stock.  

**(e)**

1. Microsoft’s β:
   - Large tech firms sometimes have β > 1, but it depends on actual estimates.
2. Comparison:
   - Ford, for example, might have a higher beta due to cyclical factors.
   - GE, IBM, and Disney each have distinct risk profiles.

**(f)**

1. Modified model:
   r_{jm} = β_j (r_m - r_f) + e_j.
2. Effect on β_j:
   - If α_j was originally close to zero, forcing α_j = 0 will not change β_j much.
   - If α_j was significantly different from zero, β_j may shift notably.
3. Interpretation:
   - If there is little difference in β_j between the two models, the CAPM assumption α_j = 0 is roughly valid.
   - A large difference indicates a departure from the pure CAPM assumption.
