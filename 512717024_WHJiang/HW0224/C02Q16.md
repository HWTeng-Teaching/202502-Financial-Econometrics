# Question:
The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is an important model in the field of finance. It explains variations in the net return on a stock as a function of the rate of return on a portfolio that includes all traded stocks, which is called the market portfolio. Specifically, the CAPM says that the expected return on a stock is the risk-free rate plus a risk premium that depends on how sensitive the stock is to movements in the market. That sensitivity is called the beta. The CAPM also says that the risk premium, \( r_{jm} - r_f \), is proportional to the market risk premium. The resulting portfolio is that

$$
r_{jm} - r_f = \beta_j (r_m - r_f)
$$

where \( r_j \) and \( r_f \) are the returns on the \( j \)th stock and the risk-free rate, respectively, and \( \beta_j \) is the \( j \)th security’s “beta” value. A stock’s beta is important in portfolio analysis because a stock with a beta greater than one is considered “aggressive,” meaning it has above-average risk and above-average expected returns. Conversely, a stock with a beta less than one is considered “defensive” since its return is less sensitive to movements in the market. In practice, we do not observe the expected return on the stock. Instead, we assume that the average returns in the data estimate a stock’s beta before purchasing it. The CAPM model shown in equation (1) is a theoretical expression in this case. The “econometric model” is obtained by including an intercept in the equation (even though theory says it should be zero) and an error term:

$$
r_{jm} = \alpha_j + \beta_j (r_m - r_f) + e_j
$$

(a) Explain why the econometric model above is a simple regression model like those discussed in the text.
## Ans:

1. Model form:
   The CAPM econometric version can be written as
   r_{jm} = α_j + β_j (r_m - r_f) + e_j,
   where r_{jm} (the excess return on the stock) is the dependent variable, (r_m - r_f) (the market’s excess return) is the single explanatory variable, α_j is the intercept, β_j is the slope, and e_j is the error term. This matches the form of a simple linear regression y = β_0 + β_1 x + ε.

2. Number of parameters:
   Only two parameters (α_j and β_j) are estimated, just like in simple linear regression.

3. Error term assumption:
   We assume the error term e_j has a mean of zero and is uncorrelated with the regressor (r_m - r_f), consistent with standard linear regression assumptions.


(b) In the data file capm5 are data on the monthly returns for five stocks (GE, IBM, Ford, Microsoft, Disney), and the excess returns on the market portfolio (MKT), and the return on the three-month T-bill as the risk-free asset (RISKFREE). The 180 observations cover January 1998 to December 2012. The variable \( r_{jm} \) is the stock’s return minus the risk-free rate. The variable \( r_m - r_f \) is the market’s return minus the risk-free rate.
## Ans:

Data description: monthly returns, excess returns, and sample period
1. Data content:
   - Monthly returns for five companies (GE, IBM, Ford, Microsoft, Disney)
   - Excess return on the market portfolio (MKT)
   - Three-month T-bill rate (RISKFREE) as the risk-free rate
   - 180 monthly observations from January 1998 to December 2012

2. Variable definitions:
   - r_{jm} = r_j - r_f: the stock’s return minus the risk-free rate
   - (r_m - r_f): the market’s return minus the risk-free rate

3. Goal:
   Use simple regression to estimate α_j and β_j for each stock and interpret β_j in terms of investment style.


(c) Regress \( r_{jm} \) on \( (r_m - r_f) \) for each stock and discuss the size of the estimated betas. Which stocks appear to be aggressive? Which are defensive?
## Ans:

Regress r_{jm} on (r_m - r_f), discuss beta estimates, and identify aggressive vs. defensive stocks
1. Regression setup:
   For each stock j, estimate r_{jm} = α_j + β_j (r_m - r_f) + e_j.
2. Interpretation of β_j:
   - β_j > 1: The stock is “aggressive,” more sensitive to market movements, implying higher risk and potentially higher expected return.
   - β_j < 1: The stock is “defensive,” less sensitive to market movements, implying lower risk and potentially lower expected return.

(d) Estimate the intercepts in the regressions. Are they all close to zero? Are they statistically different from zero?
## Ans:

1. Theoretical expectation:
   CAPM suggests α_j = 0.
2. Practical findings:
   - If α_j is near zero and not significant, it aligns with CAPM.
   - If α_j is significantly above zero, the stock may have positive abnormal returns.
   - If α_j is significantly below zero, the stock may have negative abnormal returns.
3. Statistical test:
   Use a t-test to determine whether α_j is significantly different from zero.

(e) Obtain the slope estimate for the Microsoft stock. How does it compare to the slope for the other stocks?
## Ans:

1. Microsoft’s β:
   - Large tech firms sometimes have β > 1, but it depends on actual estimates.
2. Comparison:
   - Ford, for example, might have a higher beta due to cyclical factors.
   - GE, IBM, and Disney each have distinct risk profiles.

(f) Finally, put the slope estimate under the assumption that \( \alpha_j = 0 \). Do the estimates of the betas change much?
## Ans:


(f) Imposing α_j = 0: Do the beta estimates change much?
1. Modified model:
   r_{jm} = β_j (r_m - r_f) + e_j.
2. Effect on β_j:
   - If α_j was originally close to zero, forcing α_j = 0 will not change β_j much.
   - If α_j was significantly different from zero, β_j may shift notably.
3. Interpretation:
   - If there is little difference in β_j between the two models, the CAPM assumption α_j = 0 is roughly valid.
   - A large difference indicates a departure from the pure CAPM assumption.
