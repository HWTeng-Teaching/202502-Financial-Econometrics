# Step-by-Step Answer: Deriving the Covariance Between OLS Coefficients \(b_1\) and \(b_2\)

**General Variance-Covariance Matrix:**

In the ordinary least squares (OLS) method, the variance-covariance matrix of the coefficient vector \(\mathbf{b}\) is given by

\[
\text{Var}(\mathbf{b}) = \sigma^2 \left( X'X \right)^{-1},
\]

where \(\sigma^2\) is the error variance.

---

**For \(K = 2\):**

Suppose the design matrix \(X\) is an \(n \times 2\) matrix. Define the following sums:

- \(a = \sum_{i=1}^n x_{i1}^2\)
- \(b = \sum_{i=1}^n x_{i1} x_{i2}\)
- \(d = \sum_{i=1}^n x_{i2}^2\)

Then, the matrix \(X'X\) is

\[
X'X = \begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
b & d \\
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

Its inverse, using the formula for a \(2 \times 2\) matrix, is

\[
(X'X)^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad - b^2} \begin{pmatrix}
d & -b \\
-b & a \\
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

---

**Deriving \(\text{cov}(b_1, b_2)\):**

Multiplying the inverse by \(\sigma^2\) gives

\[
\text{Var}(\mathbf{b}) = \sigma^2 (X'X)^{-1} = \frac{\sigma^2}{ad - b^2} \begin{pmatrix}
d & -b \\
-b & a \\
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

The off-diagonal elements represent the covariance between \(b_1\) and \(b_2\). Therefore, we have

\[
\text{cov}(b_1, b_2) = -\frac{\sigma^2 b}{ad - b^2}.
\]

---

**Conclusion:**

The covariance between the OLS coefficient estimates \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) for a model with two regressors is given by

\[
\boxed{\text{cov}(b_1, b_2) = -\frac{\sigma^2 b}{ad - b^2}},
\]

which matches the formulas provided in the reference material.
