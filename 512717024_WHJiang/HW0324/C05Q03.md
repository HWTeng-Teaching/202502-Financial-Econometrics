## (a)  Fill in the following blank spaces  

i. t-statistic for β₁: 0.6593  

ii. Standard error for β₂: 0.4840  

iii. Estimate for β₃: –1.4547  

 Coefficient = t × Std. Error = –3.9376 × 0.3695 ≈ –1.4547  
 
iv. To compute R², we need SSE and SST. From the output, SSE = 5.752896. To find SST, we use the result  which gives 
SST = 1199 (6.39547)² = 49041.5 
    
v. σ̂ (Standard error of regression): [computed from SSE and degrees of freedom]

## (b) Interpret the estimates of β₂, β₃, and β₄

- **β₂ = 2.7648:** A 1% increase in total expenditure increases alcohol budget share by 2.76 percentage points.
  
- **β₃ = –1.4547:** Each additional child reduces alcohol budget share by 1.45 percentage points.
  
- **β₄ = –0.1503:** Each additional year in household head age reduces alcohol budget share by 0.15 percentage points.

## (c) 95% Confidence Interval for β₄

$$
\[
\beta_4 \pm z_{0.025} \cdot SE = -0.1503 \pm 1.96 \times 0.0235 = -0.1503 \pm 0.0461 \Rightarrow [-0.1964, -0.1042]
\]
$$

**Interpretation:** With 95% confidence, a one-year increase in age reduces alcohol budget share between 0.1042 and 0.1964 percentage points.

## (d) Significance at 5% level

- **β₁ (p = 0.5099):** Not significant
- 
- **β₂, β₃, β₄ (p < 0.05):** Statistically significant

---

## (e) Test hypothesis: β₃ = –2 vs. β₃ ≠ –2

- **H₀:** β₃ = –2
  
- **H₁:** β₃ ≠ –2

Critical value at 5% significance ≈ ±1.96

**Conclusion:** Fail to reject H₀. There is insufficient evidence to show that β₃ ≠ –2.
