(a) Filling in the missing entries  
**Coefficient of ln(TOTEXP)**

Given the standard error is 0.2619 and the t-statistic is -5.7136, we compute

\[
\hat{\beta}_2 = -5.7136 \times 0.2619 \approx -1.496.
\]

**Coefficient and t-statistic for NK**

The table suggests “-0.15231” might be the actual coefficient rather than the t-statistic, because a t-stat of -0.15 would not yield a p-value of 0.0000.

Assuming \(\hat{\beta}_3 = -0.15231\) and a large negative t-value (e.g., around -6.4), the standard error would be roughly 0.0238.

**Standard error for AGE**

With \(\hat{\beta}_4 = -0.0257\) and \(t = -6.4019\), the standard error is approximately

\[
\frac{0.0257}{6.4019} \approx 0.0040.
\]

**Intercept’s standard error and t-stat**

\(\hat{\beta}_1 = 2.7468\) and a p-value of 0.0009 suggest a reasonably large t-stat (around 3.2–3.3).

Hence, a plausible standard error is about

\[
\frac{2.7468}{3.3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Putting these values into the table might yield something like:

| Coefficient  | Std. Error | t-Statistic | Prob.  |
|--------------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Intercept    | 2.7468     | 0.83        | 3.31   | 0.0009 |
| ln(TOTEXP)   | -1.496     | 0.2619      | -5.71  | 0.0000 |
| NK           | -0.15231   | 0.0238      | -6.40  | 0.0000 |
| AGE          | -0.0257    | 0.0040      | -6.4019| 0.0000 |

*Note: The above is a reasonable reconstruction, not necessarily the exact official output.*

(b) **Interpretation of the coefficients**

**\(\beta_1\) (Intercept):**

When \(\ln(\text{TOTEXP}) = 0\), \(NK = 0\), and \(AGE = 0\), the predicted budget share for alcohol (WALC) is about 2.7468. This mainly serves as a baseline in the regression.

**\(\beta_2\) (ln(TOTEXP)):**

Approximately -1.496, indicating that if total expenditure rises by a factor of \(e\) (i.e., \(\ln(\text{TOTEXP})\) increases by 1), the budget share for alcohol decreases by about 1.496 percentage points (depending on how WALC is scaled). This suggests wealthier households (higher TOTEXP) allocate a smaller share to alcohol.

**\(\beta_3\) (NK):**

Around -0.15231, meaning each additional child reduces the alcohol budget share by roughly 0.15 (or 15 percentage points if WALC is measured on a 0–100 scale, or 0.15 if WALC is a fraction). Households with more children tend to spend proportionally less on alcohol.

**\(\beta_4\) (AGE):**

About -0.0257, indicating that for each extra year of the head’s age, the budget share for alcohol declines by 0.0257. This could reflect shifting preferences or health considerations as age increases.

---

(c) **Hypothesis test: Does one extra child reduce WALC by exactly 2 percentage points?**

Formally, test the hypotheses:

\[
H_0: \beta_3 = -0.02 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_1: \beta_3 \neq -0.02.
\]

If our estimate is \(\hat{\beta}_3 = -0.15231\) (example) with a standard error of about 0.0238, then

\[
t = \frac{-0.15231 - (-0.02)}{0.0238} = \frac{-0.13231}{0.0238} \approx -5.56.
\]

Since \(|t|\) is much larger than 1.96 (for a 5% significance level), we would reject \(H_0\), implying the effect of an extra child is significantly more than a 2 percentage-point decrease.

*Exact numbers depend on the final official coefficient and standard error.*

---

(d) **Additional remarks**

**Sign interpretation:**

- A negative \(\beta_2\) suggests alcohol is not a luxury good in terms of budget share; as total expenditure grows, the share allocated to alcohol drops.
- A negative \(\beta_3\) implies a trade-off between children and alcohol spending share.
- A negative \(\beta_4\) indicates older household heads spend less (in share terms) on alcohol, possibly due to lifestyle or health changes.

**Model fit (R-squared):**

If the R-squared (e.g., ~0.46) is moderate, the model explains around half of the variation in WALC. Diagnostic checks would be needed for a thorough evaluation.
