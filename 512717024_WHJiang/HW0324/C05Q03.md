**(a)**  Fill in the following blank spaces  

i. t-statistic for Œ≤‚ÇÅ: 

$$
t = \frac{\text{Coefficient}}{\text{Std. Error}} = \frac{1.4515}{2.2019} \approx 0.6592
$$

ii. Standard error for Œ≤‚ÇÇ: 

$$
t = \frac{\text{Coefficient}}{\text{Std. Error}} \Rightarrow \text{Std. Error} = \frac{2.7648}{5.7103} \approx 0.4842
$$

iii. Estimate for Œ≤‚ÇÉ: 

 Coefficient = t √ó Std. Error = ‚Äì3.9376 √ó 0.3695 ‚âà ‚Äì1.4549  
 
(iv)  R¬≤ :  To compute R¬≤ , we need SSE and SST. From the output,  SSE=5.752896  . 

To find  SST, we use the result

$$
s_y = \sqrt{\frac{SST}{N - 1}} = 6.39547
$$

which gives  SST= 1199 (6.39547)2= 49041.5   , Thus,

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SST} = 1 - \frac{46221.6}{49041.5} = 0.0575
$$

    
v. œÉÃÇ (Standard error of regression): 

$$
\hat{\sigma} = \sqrt{\frac{SSE}{N - K}} = \sqrt{\frac{46221.62}{1200 - 4}} = 6.217
$$

**(b)** Interpret the estimates of Œ≤‚ÇÇ, Œ≤‚ÇÉ, and Œ≤‚ÇÑ

- **Œ≤‚ÇÇ = 2.7648:** A 1% increase in total expenditure increases alcohol budget share by 2.76 percentage points.
  
- **Œ≤‚ÇÉ = ‚Äì1.454943:** Each additional child reduces alcohol budget share by 1.45 percentage points.
  
- **Œ≤‚ÇÑ = ‚Äì0.1503:** Each additional year in household head age reduces alcohol budget share by 0.15 percentage points.

---

**(c)** 95% Confidence Interval for Œ≤‚ÇÑ

$$

\beta_4 \pm z_{0.025} \cdot SE = -0.1503 \pm 1.96 \times 0.0235 = -0.1503 \pm 0.0461 \Rightarrow [-0.1964, -0.1042]

$$

**Interpretation:** With 95% confidence, a one-year increase in age reduces alcohol budget share between 0.1042 and 0.1964 percentage points.

**(d)** Significance at 5% level

- **Œ≤‚ÇÅ (p = 0.5099) :**  Not significant
 
- **Œ≤‚ÇÇ, Œ≤‚ÇÉ, Œ≤‚ÇÑ (p < 0.05) :**  Statistically significant

Conclusion:

Except for the intercept term ùõΩ1, all other coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% significance level.

**(e)** Test hypothesis: Œ≤‚ÇÉ = ‚Äì2 vs. Œ≤‚ÇÉ ‚â† ‚Äì2

- **H‚ÇÄ:** Œ≤‚ÇÉ = ‚Äì2
  
- **H‚ÇÅ:** Œ≤‚ÇÉ ‚â† ‚Äì2

$$
t = \frac{-1.4547 - (-2)}{0.3695} \approx \frac{0.5453}{0.3695} \approx 1.475
$$

Critical value at 5% significance ‚âà ¬±1.96

**Conclusion:** Fail to reject H‚ÇÄ. There is insufficient evidence to show that Œ≤‚ÇÉ ‚â† ‚Äì2.
