**(a)** 
Q: What signs would you expect on the coefficients β₂, β₃, and β₄?

Ans:

Expected Signs of the Coefficients
β₂ (QUANT): Expected to be negative(-). Larger transaction volumes are typically associated with lower per-unit prices due to quantity discounts.
β₃ (QUAL): Expected to be positive(+). Higher purity is assumed to command a higher price, reflecting a quality premium.
β₄ (TREND): Expected to be negative(-). Over time, prices may decline due to increasing supply, law enforcement pressure, or market maturity.

**(b)** Estimation Results and Interpretation

Since we do not have the actual dataset, the following is a theoretical explanation:

You would typically report:
- Estimated coefficients (β̂₁, β̂₂, β̂₃, β̂₄)
- t-statistics or p-values
- Goodness-of-fit measures such as R²

**Coefficients Interpretation:**
- **β̂₂:** If negative, it implies that each additional gram in QUANT reduces the per-gram price by |β̂₂| dollars, consistent with quantity discounts.
- **β̂₃:** If positive, it implies that each 1% increase in purity (QUAL) raises the per-gram price by β̂₃ dollars, reflecting a quality premium.
- **β̂₄:** If positive, it suggests that for each additional time unit (year), the price increases by β̂₄ dollars per gram; if negative, the price decreases over time.

Check if the estimated signs align with the hypothesized ones.

## (c) Proportion of Variation Explained

Use R² (or adjusted R²) to determine the proportion of the variation in PRICE explained by QUANT, QUAL, and TREND.

For instance, if R² = 0.6, it indicates that 60% of the variation in PRICE is explained by these three regressors.

## (d) Hypothesis Test Regarding the Effect of Quantity

The claim is that more quantity means sellers face higher risk and want to sell quickly at a lower price, implying β₂ < 0.

**Set up the hypotheses:**
- H₀: β₂ = 0 (no effect of quantity on price)
- H₁: β₂ < 0 (quantity has a negative effect on price)

Perform a one-sided t-test. If the p-value is less than the significance level, reject H₀ and conclude that quantity has a significantly negative impact on price.

## (e) Hypothesis Test Regarding the Effect of Quality

**Hypothesis:**
- H₀: β₃ = 0 (no effect of quality on price)
- H₁: β₃ > 0 (higher quality leads to higher price)

Again, use a t-test for β̂₃. Reject H₀ if the p-value is sufficiently small, indicating a positive and significant relationship between quality and price.

## (f) Average Annual Change in Cocaine Price

If TREND is coded such that each increment corresponds to one year, then β₄ represents the average yearly change in PRICE.

For example, if β̂₄ = 0.5, then the price increases by $0.50 per gram each year on average; if it is negative, the price decreases.

**Possible reasons for price trends include:**
- **Supply factors:** Changes in production costs, law enforcement, distribution channels.
- **Demand factors:** Changes in consumer demand, availability of substitutes, overall economic conditions.
- **Policy or enforcement changes:** Tighter enforcement could raise risk and price; increased competition could lower price.
