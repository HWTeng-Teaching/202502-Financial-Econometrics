**(a)** 
Q: What signs would you expect on the coefficients β₂, β₃, and β₄?

Ans:

Expected Signs of the Coefficients
β₂ (QUANT): Expected to be negative(-). Larger transaction volumes are typically associated with lower per-unit prices due to quantity discounts.
β₃ (QUAL): Expected to be positive(+). Higher purity is assumed to command a higher price, reflecting a quality premium.
β₄ (TREND): Expected to be negative(-). Over time, prices may decline due to increasing supply, law enforcement pressure, or market maturity.

**(b)** 
Q: Use your computer software to estimate the equation. Report the results and interpret the coefficient estimates. Have the signs turned out as you expected?

Ans:
### price = 90.85 -0.06 *quant + 0.12 *qual -2.35 *trend 

|              |   Estimate   |  Std. Error  |   t value   |      Pr(>|t|)      |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------|
| (Intercept)  | 90.84668753  | 8.58025368   | 10.5878790  | 1.393119e-14       |
| quant        | -0.05996979  | 0.01017828   | -5.8919359  | 2.850720e-07       |
| qual         | 0.11620520   | 0.20326448   | 0.5716946   | 5.699920e-01       |
| trend        | -2.35457895  | 1.38612032   | -1.6986829  | 9.535543e-02       |

**(R code)**
  
## (c) Proportion of Variation Explained

Use R² (or adjusted R²) to determine the proportion of the variation in PRICE explained by QUANT, QUAL, and TREND.

For instance, if R² = 0.6, it indicates that 60% of the variation in PRICE is explained by these three regressors.

## (d) Hypothesis Test Regarding the Effect of Quantity

The claim is that more quantity means sellers face higher risk and want to sell quickly at a lower price, implying β₂ < 0.

**Set up the hypotheses:**
- H₀: β₂ = 0 (no effect of quantity on price)
- H₁: β₂ < 0 (quantity has a negative effect on price)

Perform a one-sided t-test. If the p-value is less than the significance level, reject H₀ and conclude that quantity has a significantly negative impact on price.

## (e) Hypothesis Test Regarding the Effect of Quality

**Hypothesis:**
- H₀: β₃ = 0 (no effect of quality on price)
- H₁: β₃ > 0 (higher quality leads to higher price)

Again, use a t-test for β̂₃. Reject H₀ if the p-value is sufficiently small, indicating a positive and significant relationship between quality and price.

## (f) Average Annual Change in Cocaine Price

If TREND is coded such that each increment corresponds to one year, then β₄ represents the average yearly change in PRICE.

For example, if β̂₄ = 0.5, then the price increases by $0.50 per gram each year on average; if it is negative, the price decreases.

**Possible reasons for price trends include:**
- **Supply factors:** Changes in production costs, law enforcement, distribution channels.
- **Demand factors:** Changes in consumer demand, availability of substitutes, overall economic conditions.
- **Policy or enforcement changes:** Tighter enforcement could raise risk and price; increased competition could lower price.
