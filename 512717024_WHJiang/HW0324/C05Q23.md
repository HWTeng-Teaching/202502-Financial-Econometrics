**(a)** 
Q: What signs would you expect on the coefficients β₂, β₃, and β₄?

Ans:

Expected Signs of the Coefficients
β₂ (QUANT): Expected to be negative(-). Larger transaction volumes are typically associated with lower per-unit prices due to quantity discounts.
β₃ (QUAL): Expected to be positive(+). Higher purity is assumed to command a higher price, reflecting a quality premium.
β₄ (TREND): Expected to be negative(-). Over time, prices may decline due to increasing supply, law enforcement pressure, or market maturity.

Q: Use your computer software to estimate the equation. Report the results and interpret the coefficient estimates. Have the signs turned out as you expected?

Ans:
### price = 90.85 -0.06 *quant + 0.12 *qual -2.35 *trend

Q: What proportion of variation in cocaine price is explained jointly by variation in quantity, quality, and time?

Ans:
### Model R² = 0.5097 ~51%

This means about 51% of the variation in price is explained by the model (QUANT, QUAL, and TREND)
*[51%] This suggests moderate explanatory power."

Q: It is claimed that the greater the number of sales, the higher the risk of getting caught. Thus, sellers are willing to accept a lower price if they can make sales in larger quantities. Set up H₀ and H₁ that would be appropriate to test this hypothesis. Carry out the hypothesis test.

Ans:

The claim is that more quantity means sellers face higher risk and want to sell quickly at a lower price, implying β₂ < 0.

**Set up the hypotheses:**
- H₀: β₂ = 0 (no effect of quantity on price)
- H₁: β₂ < 0 (quantity has a negative effect on price)

Perform a one-sided t-test. If the p-value is less than the significance level, reject H₀ and conclude that quantity has a significantly negative impact on price.

Q: Test the hypothesis that the quality of cocaine has no influence on expected price against the alternative that a premium is paid for better-quality cocaine.

Ans:

**Hypothesis:**
- H₀: β₃ = 0 (no effect of quality on price)
- H₁: β₃ > 0 (higher quality leads to higher price)

Again, use a t-test for β̂₃. Reject H₀ if the p-value is sufficiently small, indicating a positive and significant relationship between quality and price.

**(f)**
Q: What is the average annual change in the cocaine price? Can you suggest why price might be changing in this direction?

Ans:


If TREND is coded such that each increment corresponds to one year, then β₄ represents the average yearly change in PRICE.

For example, if β̂₄ = 0.5, then the price increases by $0.50 per gram each year on average; if it is negative, the price decreases.

**Possible reasons for price trends include:**
- **Supply factors:** Changes in production costs, law enforcement, distribution channels.
- **Demand factors:** Changes in consumer demand, availability of substitutes, overall economic conditions.
- **Policy or enforcement changes:** Tighter enforcement could raise risk and price; increased competition could lower price.
