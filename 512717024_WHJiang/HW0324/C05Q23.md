**(a)** 
Q: What signs would you expect on the coefficients β₂, β₃, and β₄?

Ans:

Expected Signs of the Coefficients
β₂ (QUANT): Expected to be negative(-). Larger transaction volumes are typically associated with lower per-unit prices due to quantity discounts.
β₃ (QUAL): Expected to be positive(+). Higher purity is assumed to command a higher price, reflecting a quality premium.
β₄ (TREND): Expected to be negative(-). Over time, prices may decline due to increasing supply, law enforcement pressure, or market maturity.

Q: Use your computer software to estimate the equation. Report the results and interpret the coefficient estimates. Have the signs turned out as you expected?

Ans:
### price = 90.85 -0.06 *quant + 0.12 *qual -2.35 *trend

Q: What proportion of variation in cocaine price is explained jointly by variation in quantity, quality, and time?

Ans:
### Model R² = 0.5097 ~51%

This means about 51% of the variation in price is explained by the model (QUANT, QUAL, and TREND).

*[51%] This suggests moderate explanatory power

Q: It is claimed that the greater the number of sales, the higher the risk of getting caught. Thus, sellers are willing to accept a lower price if they can make sales in larger quantities. Set up H₀ and H₁ that would be appropriate to test this hypothesis. Carry out the hypothesis test.

Ans:

**Set up the hypotheses:**
- H₀: β₂ ≥ 0 (no effect of quantity on price)
- H₁: β₂ < 0 (quantity has a negative effect on price)
Result：
t value = -5.892 , one-tailed p value = 1.425e-07 

*For this hypothesis, The calculated t-value is -5.892. We reject H0.(less than or equal to the critical 
(t-=1.675, 0.95,n-4). To conclude that sellers are willing to accept a lower price if they can make sales in larger quantities.

Q: Test the hypothesis that the quality of cocaine has no influence on expected price against the alternative that a premium is paid for better-quality cocaine.

Ans:

**Set up the Hypothesis:**
- H₀: β₃ ≤ 0 (no effect of quality on price)
- H₁: β₃ > 0 (higher quality leads to higher price)
Result：
t value = 0.572 , one-tailed p value = 0.284996

*The calculated t-value is 0.5717. At α=0.05, we can not reject H0 by the calculated t is less than or equal to 1.675. 

& We cannot conclude that a premium is paid for better quality cocaine.

Q: What is the average annual change in the cocaine price? Can you suggest why price might be changing in this direction?

Ans:

### average annual change in the cocaine price (β₄) = -2.35 USD per year

*The average annual change in the cocaine price is given by the value of -2.3546. It has a negative sign suggesting that the price decreases over time. A possible reason for a decreasing price is the development of improved technology for producing cocaine, such hat suppliers can produce more at the same cost.
