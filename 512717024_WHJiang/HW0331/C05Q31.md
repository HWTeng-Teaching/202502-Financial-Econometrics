### C05Q31

Each morning between 6:30 AM and 8:00 AM Bill leaves the Melbourne suburb of Carnegie to drive to work at the University of Melbourne. The time it takes Bill to drive to work (TIME) depends on the departure time (DEPART), the number of red lights that he encounters (REDS), and the number of trains that he has to wait for at the Murrumbeena level crossing (TRAINS). Observations on these variables for the 249 working days in 2015 appear in the file *commute5*. TIME is measured in minutes. DEPART is the number of minutes after 6:30 AM that Bill departs.

**a.** Estimate the equation:  

$$
\ TIME = \beta_1 + \beta_2\,DEPART + \beta_3\,REDS + \beta_4\,TRAINS + e \  
$$

Report the results and interpret each of the coefficient estimates, including the intercept β₁.

**b.** Find 95% interval estimates for each of the coefficients. Have you obtained precise estimates of each of the coefficients?

**c.** Using a 5% significance level, test the null hypothesis that Bill’s expected delay from each red light is 2 minutes or more against the alternative that it is less than 2 minutes.

**d.** Using a 10% significance level, test the null hypothesis that the expected delay from each train is 3 minutes against the alternative that it is not 3 minutes.

**e.** Using a 5% significance level, test the null hypothesis that Bill can expect a trip to be at least 10 minutes longer if he leaves at 7:30 AM instead of 7:00 AM, against the alternative that it will not be 10 minutes longer. (Assume other things are equal.)

**f.** Using a 5% significance level, test the null hypothesis that the expected delay from a train is at least three times greater than the expected delay from a red light against the alternative that it is less than three times greater.

**g.** Suppose that Bill encounters six red lights and one train. Using a 5% significance level, test the null hypothesis that leaving Carnegie at 7:00 AM is early enough to get him to the university on or before 7:45 AM against the alternative that it is not.  
[Carry out the test in terms of the expected time \(E(TIME|X)\) where \(X\) represents the observations on all explanatory variables.]

**h.** Suppose that, in part (g), it is imperative that Bill is not late for his 7:45 AM meeting. Have the null and alternative hypotheses been set up correctly? What happens if these hypotheses are reversed?

### Ans:

**(a)** Estimating the Model and Interpreting Coefficients

**Model Estimation:**  
Estimate the following OLS regression:

$$
TIME = \beta_1 + \beta_2\,DEPART + \beta_3\,REDS + \beta_4\,TRAINS + e.
$$

**Interpretation:**

- **β₁ (Intercept):** The expected travel time when DEPART, REDS, and TRAINS are zero. Although such a scenario may not occur in practice, it sets the baseline level.
- **β₂:** The change in travel time for each additional minute delay in departure. A positive β₂ indicates that leaving later increases travel time.
- **β₃:** The additional travel time (in minutes) associated with each extra red light encountered.
- **β₄:** The extra travel time incurred per train delay.

---

## (b) 95% Confidence Intervals and Precision

**Method:**  
Construct 95% confidence intervals for each coefficient using the standard errors from the regression.

**Precision:**  
Narrow intervals suggest high precision, while wide intervals indicate less precise estimates.

---

## (c) Hypothesis Test for the Delay from Each Red Light

**Hypotheses:**

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** \( \beta_3 \ge 2 \)  
  (each red light delays at least 2 minutes)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** \( \beta_3 < 2 \)

**Testing:**  
Perform a one-sided (left-tailed) t-test at the 5% significance level to determine if there is sufficient evidence to reject \( H_0 \).

---

## (d) Hypothesis Test for the Delay from Each Train

**Hypotheses:**

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** \( \beta_4 = 3 \)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** \( \beta_4 \neq 3 \)

**Testing:**  
Conduct a two-sided t-test at the 10% significance level to assess whether \( \beta_4 \) significantly differs from 3 minutes.

---

## (e) Testing the Impact of Departure Time on Travel Time

**Context:**  
Departing at 7:00 AM (DEPART = 30) versus 7:30 AM (DEPART = 60) implies a difference of 30 minutes in DEPART. The expected difference in TIME is \( 30\beta_2 \).

**Hypotheses:**

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** \( 30\beta_2 \ge 10 \)  
  (i.e., \( \beta_2 \ge 0.3333 \))
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** \( 30\beta_2 < 10 \)  
  (i.e., \( \beta_2 < 0.3333 \))

**Testing:**  
A one-tailed t-test is used to determine if the additional delay is statistically less than 10 minutes.

---

## (f) Testing the Relative Impact of Trains vs. Red Lights

**Hypotheses:**

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** \( \beta_4 \ge 3\beta_3 \)  
  (i.e., the train delay is at least three times the red light delay)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** \( \beta_4 < 3\beta_3 \)

**Testing:**  
Equivalently, test if \( \beta_4 - 3\beta_3 \ge 0 \) versus \( < 0 \) using a one-sided t-test at the 5% significance level.

---

## (g) Testing if a 7:00 AM Departure Ensures Timely Arrival

**Scenario:**  
For DEPART = 30, REDS = 6, and TRAINS = 1, the expected travel time is:

$$
E(TIME \mid X) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \times 30 + \beta_3 \times 6 + \beta_4 \times 1.
$$

**Hypotheses:**

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** \( E(TIME \mid X) \le 45 \) minutes  
  (i.e., arrival at or before 7:45 AM)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** \( E(TIME \mid X) > 45 \) minutes  
  (i.e., arrival later than 7:45 AM)

**Testing:**  
Use a one-sided t-test based on the linear combination of coefficients to evaluate whether the expected travel time exceeds 45 minutes.

---

## (h) Discussion on Hypotheses Setup When Timeliness is Imperative

**Issue:**  
If it is critical that Bill is not late for his 7:45 AM meeting, the testing framework should focus on ensuring timeliness.

**Current Setup (from part g):**

- **Null Hypothesis:** \( E(TIME \mid X) \le 45 \) (i.e., Bill arrives on time)
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** \( E(TIME \mid X) > 45 \)

**Reversal Consideration:**  
For a scenario where lateness is unacceptable, one might reverse the hypotheses:

- **Revised Null Hypothesis:** \( E(TIME \mid X) > 45 \)  
  (i.e., there is a risk of being late)
- **Revised Alternative Hypothesis:** \( E(TIME \mid X) \le 45 \)  
  (i.e., Bill arrives on time)

Reversing the hypotheses changes the burden of proof and the interpretation of Type I and Type II errors. It shifts the focus toward needing strong evidence that Bill will indeed be on time.
