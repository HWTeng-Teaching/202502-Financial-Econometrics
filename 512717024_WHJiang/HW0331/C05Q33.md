### C05Q33

Use the observations in the data file `cps5_small` to estimate the following model:

$$
\ln(WAGE) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \, EDUC + \beta_3 \, EDUC^2 + \beta_4 \, EXPER + \beta_5 \, EXPER^2 + \beta_6 \, (EDUC \times EXPER) + e
$$

**a.** At what levels of significance are each of the coefficient estimates “significantly different from zero”?

**b.** Obtain an expression for the marginal effect 
$$\frac{\partial E[\ln(WAGE)|EDUC, EXPER]}{\partial EDUC}.$$ 
Comment on how the estimate of this marginal effect changes as `EDUC` and `EXPER` increase.

**c.** Evaluate the marginal effect in part (b) for all observations in the sample and construct a histogram of these effects. What have you discovered? Find the median, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile of the marginal effects.

**d.** Obtain an expression for the marginal effect 
$$\frac{\partial E[\ln(WAGE)|EDUC, EXPER]}{\partial EXPER}.$$ 
Comment on how the estimate of this marginal effect changes as `EDUC` and `EXPER` increase.

**e.** Evaluate the marginal effect in part (d) for all observations in the sample and construct a histogram of these effects. What have you discovered? Find the median, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile of the marginal effects.

**f.** David has 17 years of education and 8 years of experience, while Svetlana has 16 years of education and 18 years of experience. Using a 5% significance level, test the null hypothesis that Svetlana’s expected log-wage is equal to or greater than David’s expected log-wage, against the alternative that David’s expected log-wage is greater. State the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the model parameters.

**g.** After eight years have passed, when David and Svetlana have had eight more years of experience but no additional education, will the test result in (f) be the same? Explain this outcome.

**h.** Wendy has 12 years of education and 17 years of experience, while Jill has 16 years of education and 11 years of experience. Using a 5% significance level, test the null hypothesis that their marginal effects of extra experience are equal against the alternative that they are not. State the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the model parameters.

**i.** How much longer will it be before the marginal effect of experience for Jill becomes negative? Find a 95% interval estimate for this quantity.

## (a) Significance Levels of the Coefficient Estimates

**Steps:**

1. **Estimate the Regression:**  
   Use the cps5_small data to estimate the regression model.

2. **Compute t-Statistics and p-Values:**  
   For each coefficient (β₁ to β₆), calculate the t-statistic and its corresponding p-value.

3. **Determine the Significance Level:**  
   - If p < 0.01, the coefficient is significant at the 1% level.
   - If 0.01 ≤ p < 0.05, it is significant at the 5% level.
   - If 0.05 ≤ p < 0.10, it is significant at the 10% level.

4. **Report the Results:**  
   Based on the computed p-values, report the significance of each coefficient accordingly.

> **Note:** The actual numerical values depend on the regression output.

## (b) Marginal Effect with Respect to EDUC

**Derivation:**

Given the model

$$
\ln(WAGE) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \, EDUC + \beta_3 \, EDUC^2 + \beta_4 \, EXPER + \beta_5 \, EXPER^2 + \beta_6 \, (EDUC \times EXPER) + e,
$$

differentiate with respect to EDUC:

$$
\frac{\partial E[\ln(WAGE) \mid EDUC,\,EXPER]}{\partial EDUC} = \beta_2 + 2\beta_3 \, EDUC + \beta_6 \, EXPER.
$$

**Comment:**

- As EDUC increases, if β₃ is negative, the marginal effect declines (diminishing returns); if positive, it increases.
- The term $\beta_6 \times EXPER$ shows that the effect of education is modified by work experience.

## (c) Evaluation and Histogram of the EDUC Marginal Effect

**Procedure:**

1. **Compute the Marginal Effect:**  
   For each observation, calculate the marginal effect using

   $$
   \beta_2 + 2\beta_3 \, EDUC + \beta_6 \, EXPER.
   $$

2. **Plot a Histogram:**  
   Plot a histogram of these computed marginal effects.

3. **Summarize the Distribution:**  
   Report the median, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile of the marginal effects.

**Observation:**  
The histogram may reveal substantial heterogeneity in the effect of education on log-wage across individuals. Specific numerical summaries depend on the estimation results.

---

## (d) Marginal Effect with Respect to EXPER

**Derivation:**

Differentiate the model with respect to EXPER:

$$
\frac{\partial E[\ln(WAGE) \mid EDUC,\,EXPER]}{\partial EXPER} = \beta_4 + 2\beta_5 \, EXPER + \beta_6 \, EDUC.
$$

**Comment:**

- As EXPER increases, if β₅ is positive (or negative), the marginal effect increases (or decreases) nonlinearly.
- The effect of EDUC via β₆ also plays a role in modifying the experience effect.

## (e) Evaluation and Histogram of the EXPER Marginal Effect

**Procedure:**

1. **Compute the Marginal Effect:**  
   For each observation, calculate

   $$
   \beta_4 + 2\beta_5 \, EXPER + \beta_6 \, EDUC.
   $$

2. **Plot a Histogram:**  
   Plot a histogram of these computed values.

3. **Summarize the Distribution:**  
   Report the median, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile.

**Observation:**  
The distribution may show considerable variation, reflecting heterogeneous effects of experience on log-wage.

## (f) Testing Wage Differences Between David and Svetlana

**Expected Log-Wage Calculation:**

- **For David:**

  $$
  \mu_D = \beta_1 + \beta_2(17) + \beta_3(17^2) + \beta_4(8) + \beta_5(8^2) + \beta_6(17 \times 8).
  $$

- **For Svetlana:**

  $$
  \mu_S = \beta_1 + \beta_2(16) + \beta_3(16^2) + \beta_4(18) + \beta_5(18^2) + \beta_6(16 \times 18).
  $$

**Hypotheses:**

Let

$$
\Delta = \mu_D - \mu_S.
$$

Then, set:

- **Null Hypothesis:**  
  $H_0: \Delta \le 0$  
  (i.e., Svetlana’s expected log-wage is at least as high as David’s)

- **Alternative Hypothesis:**  
  $H_1: \Delta > 0$  
  (i.e., David’s expected log-wage is higher)

**Simplification:**

Since β₁ cancels, we have

$$
\Delta = \beta_2(17 - 16) + \beta_3(17^2 - 16^2) + \beta_4(8 - 18) + \beta_5(8^2 - 18^2) + \beta_6(17 \times 8 - 16 \times 18).
$$

**Calculations:**

- \(17 - 16 = 1\)
- \(17^2 - 16^2 = 33\)
- \(8 - 18 = -10\)
- \(8^2 - 18^2 = -260\)
- \(17 \times 8 - 16 \times 18 = -152\)

Thus,

$$
\Delta = \beta_2 + 33\beta_3 - 10\beta_4 - 260\beta_5 - 152\beta_6.
$$

**Test:**  
Using a 5% significance level, perform a t-test for \(H_0: \Delta \le 0\) against \(H_1: \Delta > 0\).

## (g) Effect of Additional 8 Years of Experience

**New Situation:**

- David’s experience increases from 8 to 16 years (EDUC remains 17).
- Svetlana’s experience increases from 18 to 26 years (EDUC remains 16).

**New Difference:**

$$
\Delta' = \beta_2(17 - 16) + \beta_3(17^2 - 16^2) + \beta_4(16 - 26) + \beta_5(16^2 - 26^2) + \beta_6(17 \times 16 - 16 \times 26).
$$

**Calculations:**

- \(17 - 16 = 1\)
- \(17^2 - 16^2 = 33\)
- \(16 - 26 = -10\)
- \(16^2 - 26^2 = 256 - 676 = -420\)
- \(17 \times 16 - 16 \times 26 = 272 - 416 = -144\)

Hence,

$$
\Delta' = \beta_2 + 33\beta_3 - 10\beta_4 - 420\beta_5 - 144\beta_6.
$$

**Explanation:**  
Because the experience-related terms change nonlinearly (due to the quadratic and interaction terms), the difference \(\Delta'\) is not identical to \(\Delta\) from part (f). Thus, the hypothesis test result may differ after 8 additional years of experience.

## (h) Testing Equality of Marginal Effects of Experience (Wendy vs. Jill)

**Marginal Effect Formula (with respect to EXPER):**

$$
ME = \beta_4 + 2\beta_5 \, EXPER + \beta_6 \, EDUC.
$$

**For Each Individual:**

- **Wendy** (12 years education, 17 years experience):

  $$
  ME_W = \beta_4 + 2\beta_5(17) + \beta_6(12) = \beta_4 + 34\beta_5 + 12\beta_6.
  $$

- **Jill** (16 years education, 11 years experience):

  $$
  ME_J = \beta_4 + 2\beta_5(11) + \beta_6(16) = \beta_4 + 22\beta_5 + 16\beta_6.
  $$

**Hypotheses:**

- **Null Hypothesis:**  
  \(H_0: ME_W = ME_J\)

- **Alternative Hypothesis:**  
  \(H_1: ME_W \neq ME_J\)

**Simplification:**

Subtracting, we have:

$$
ME_W - ME_J = (\beta_4 + 34\beta_5 + 12\beta_6) - (\beta_4 + 22\beta_5 + 16\beta_6) = 12\beta_5 - 4\beta_6.
$$

This simplifies to testing:

$$
3\beta_5 - \beta_6 = 0 \quad (H_0) \quad \text{vs.} \quad 3\beta_5 - \beta_6 \neq 0 \quad (H_1).
$$

**Test:**  
Conduct a t-test at the 5% significance level using the estimated standard error for this linear combination.

---

## (i) When Does Jill’s Experience Marginal Effect Become Negative?

**Marginal Effect for Jill (as a function of EXPER):**

$$
ME_J(EXPER) = \beta_4 + 2\beta_5 \, EXPER + \beta_6(16).
$$

**Find the Threshold:**

Set

$$
ME_J(EXPER^*) = 0,
$$

so that

$$
0 = \beta_4 + 2\beta_5 \, EXPER^* + 16\beta_6.
$$

Solving for \(EXPER^*\):

$$
EXPER^* = -\frac{\beta_4 + 16\beta_6}{2\beta_5}.
$$

**Additional Years Required:**  
If Jill currently has 11 years of experience, the additional years needed before the marginal effect becomes negative is:

$$
\Delta EXPER = EXPER^* - 11.
$$

**Interval Estimation:**  
A 95% confidence interval for \(\Delta EXPER\) can be constructed using the delta method based on the estimated coefficients and their covariance matrix.

This concludes the detailed steps and methods for the analysis.
