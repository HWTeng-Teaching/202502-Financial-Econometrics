### C05Q06

Suppose that, from a sample of 63 observations, the least squares estimates and the corresponding estimated covariance matrix are given by:

$$
[b_1, \; b_2, \; b_3]' = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\text{cov}(b_1, b_2, b_3) =
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & -2 & 1 \\
-2 & 4 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Using a 5% significance level, and an alternative hypothesis that the equality does not hold, test each of the following null hypotheses:

**a.** ( β₂ = 0 )

**b.** ( β₁ + 2β₂ = 5 )

**c.** ( β₁ − β₂ + β₃ = 4 )
