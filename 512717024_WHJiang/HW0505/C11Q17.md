## C11Q17

Example 11.3 introduces Kleinâ€™s Model I.

**(a)**
Do we have an adequate number of IVs to estimate each equation?  
Check the necessary condition for the identification of each equation.  
The necessary condition for identification is that in a system of  M  equations,  
at least  M - 1  variables must be omitted from each equation.

**(b)**
An equivalent identification condition is that the number of excluded exogenous variables  
from the equation must be at least as large as the number of included right-hand side endogenous variables.  
Check that this condition is satisfied for each equation.

**(c)**
Write down in econometric notation the first-stage equation, the reduced form,  
for W_{1t} , wages of workers earned in the private sector.  
Call the parameters \( \pi_1, \pi_2, \ldots \).

**(d)**
Describe the two regression steps of 2SLS estimation of the consumption function.  
This is not a question about a computer software command.

**(e)**
Does following the steps in part (d) produce regression results that are identical  
to the 2SLS estimates provided by software specifically designed for 2SLS estimation?  
In particular, will the \( t \)-values be the same?
