## C11Q17

Example 11.3 introduces Klein‚Äôs Model I.

**(a)**
Do we have an adequate number of IVs to estimate each equation?  Check the necessary condition for the identification of each equation.  The necessary condition for identification is that in a system of  M  equations,  at least  M - 1  variables must be omitted from each equation.

**(b)**
An equivalent identification condition is that the number of excluded exogenous variables  from the equation must be at least as large as the number of included right-hand side endogenous variables.  Check that this condition is satisfied for each equation.

**(c)**
Write down in econometric notation the first-stage equation, the reduced form,  for W_{1t} , wages of workers earned in the private sector.  Call the parameters  œÄ‚ÇÅ„ÄÅœÄ‚ÇÇ‚ãØ.

**(d)**
Describe the two regression steps of 2SLS estimation of the consumption function.  This is not a question about a computer software command.

**(e)**
Does following the steps in part (d) produce regression results that are identical  to the 2SLS estimates provided by software specifically designed for 2SLS estimation?  In particular, will the \( t \)-values be the same?

## ANS

This analysis is based on **Klein's Model I**, a classic three-equation macroeconomic model. The goal is to analyze identification and the application of Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) estimation.


üìê Structural Model: Three Equations

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Consumption Function**

$$
CN_t = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 (W_{1t} + W_{2t}) + \alpha_3 P_t + \alpha_4 P_{t-1} + e_{1t}
$$

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Investment Function**

$$
I_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2 P_t + \beta_3 P_{t-1} + \beta_4 K_{t-1} + e_{2t}
$$

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Private Sector Wage Function**

$$
W_{1t} = \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 E_t + \gamma_3 E_{t-1} + \gamma_4 TIME_t + e_{3t}
$$


**(a) Are there enough instruments? (Order Condition)Ôºü**

The order condition requires that in a system with \( M \) equations, at least \( M - 1 \) exogenous variables must be excluded from each equation.

Here, \( M = 3 \) ‚áí **at least 2 exogenous variables must be excluded** from each equation.


- 8 endogenous variablesÔºàe.g.,ÔºöCN, I, W1, P, E, E-1 Ôºâ
- 8 exogenous variablesÔºàe.g.,Ôºö G, W2, TX, TIME, P-1, K-1, E-1, \text{const} Ôºâ

‚úÖ  **Conclusion**: Each equation excludes enough instruments ‚áí All equations are identifiable.

**(b) Alternative Condition: Exclusion Count Check**

Condition: The number of excluded exogenous variables must be **at least** as large as the number of included endogenous RHS variables.

| Equation              | Endogenous RHS | Excluded Exogenous Variables | Satisfied |
|----------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Consumption Function | \( W_1, P, P_{-1} \) | \( G, TX, TIME, \ldots \)        | ‚úÖ         |
| Investment Function  | \( P, P_{-1} \)      | \( CN, W_1, TIME, TX \)          | ‚úÖ         |
| Wage Equation        | \( E_t, E_{t-1} \)   | \( CN, I, P_t \)                 | ‚úÖ         |

‚úÖ Conclusion: All equations satisfy the exclusion condition ‚áí Identified.

**(c) First-Stage Reduced Form for W1t Ôºâ**

The first-stage reduced-form equation for \( W_{1t} \) using all exogenous instruments:

$$
W_{1t} = \pi_1 + \pi_2 G_t + \pi_3 W_{2t} + \pi_4 TX_t + \pi_5 K_{t-1} + \pi_6 P_{t-1} + \pi_7 E_{t-1} + \pi_8 TIME_t + v_{1t}
$$

All exogenous variables are used as instruments in this reduced-form equation.

--

**(d)  Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) Estimation of the Consumption Function**

Step 1Ô∏è‚É£ÔºöFirst-Stage Regressions

Regress each endogenous RHS variable (e.g.,  Pt, W1t on all exogenous variables (instruments):

Example in R for  P :

P_hat <- lm(P ~ G + W2 + TX + K_lag + TIME + E_lag, data = ...)$fitted.values

All exogenous variables ùëç={ùê∫,ùëä2,ùëáùëã,ùêæ‚àí1,ùëáùêºùëÄùê∏,ùê∏‚àí1}are used to predict ùëÉThe result ùëÉ^ùë°serves as the instrumented value used in the second-stage regression

Repeat this for ùëä1ùë°W1t to get  ùëÉ^ùë°,ùëä^1ùë°

‚ÄãStep 2Ô∏è‚É£ÔºöSecond-Stage Regression

Substitute ùëÉ^ùë°and ùëä^1ùë° into the original consumption equation:

ùê∂ùëÅùë°=ùõº1+ùõº2(ùëä^1ùë°+ùëä2ùë°)+ùõº3ùëÉ^ùë°+ùõº4ùëÉùë°‚àí1+ùë¢ùë°

Estimate this equation using OLS to obtain consistent estimates of ùõº1,ùõº2,ùõº3,ùõº4


--

**(e) Will 2SLS Estimates from Manual vs Software Be the Same?**

‚úÖ Coefficient estimates will be the same

‚ö†Ô∏è Standard errors and t-values may differ

Reason:

Packages like AER::ivreg() in R compute heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors (sandwich estimator)

Manual 2SLS requires explicit robust SE calculation; otherwise, the t-values may be incorrect

‚úÖ Conclusion:

Coefficients are identical in manual and software-based 2SLS t-values match only if identical standard error estimation is used
