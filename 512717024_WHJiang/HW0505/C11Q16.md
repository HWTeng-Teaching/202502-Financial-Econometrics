## C11Q16

Consider the following supply and demand model:

**Demand equation:**  

$$
Q_i = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 P_i + e_{di} 
$$

**Supply equation:**  

$$ 
Q_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2 P_i + \beta_3 W_i + e_{si} 
$$

where \( Q \) is the quantity, \( P \) is the price, and \( W \) is the wage rate, which is assumed exogenous.  
Data on these variables are in Table 11.7.

**(a)**
Derive the algebraic form of the reduced-form equations,  

$$ 
Q = \theta_1 + \theta_2 W + \nu_2 \quad \text{and} \quad P = \pi_1 + \pi_2 W + \nu_1, 
$$

expressing the reduced-form parameters in terms of the structural parameters.

**(b)**
Which structural parameters can you solve for from the results in part (a)?  
Which equation is "identified"?

**(c)**
The estimated reduced-form equations are: 

$$
\( \hat{Q} = 5 + 0.5W \)
$$

$$
\( \hat{P} = 2.4 + 1W \)  
$$

Solve for the identified structural parameters. This is the method of **indirect least squares**.

**(d)**
Obtain the fitted values from the reduced-form equation for \( P \),  
and apply **2SLS** to obtain estimates of the demand equation.
