## C11Q16

Consider the following supply and demand model:

**Demand equation:**  

$$
Q_i = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 P_i + e_{di} 
$$

**Supply equation:**  

$$ 
Q_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2 P_i + \beta_3 W_i + e_{si} 
$$

where \( Q \) is the quantity, \( P \) is the price, and \( W \) is the wage rate, which is assumed exogenous.  
Data on these variables are in Table 11.7.

**(a)**
Derive the algebraic form of the reduced-form equations,  

$$ 
Q = \theta_1 + \theta_2 W + \nu_2 \quad \text{and} \quad P = \pi_1 + \pi_2 W + \nu_1, 
$$

expressing the reduced-form parameters in terms of the structural parameters.

**(b)**
Which structural parameters can you solve for from the results in part (a)?  
Which equation is "identified"?

**(c)**
The estimated reduced-form equations are: 

$$
\( \hat{Q} = 5 + 0.5W \)
$$

$$
\( \hat{P} = 2.4 + 1W \)  
$$

Solve for the identified structural parameters. This is the method of **indirect least squares**.

**(d)**
Obtain the fitted values from the reduced-form equation for \( P \),  
and apply **2SLS** to obtain estimates of the demand equation.

## ANS:

We consider the following structural model:

Where:
- \( Q \): Quantity
- \( P \): Price (endogenous)
- \( W \): Wage rate (exogenous)
- \( e_d, e_s \): Structural error terms


**(a) Deriving the Reduced-Form Equations**

We aim to express both  Q  and  P  as functions of the exogenous variable  W :

$$
Q = \theta_1 + \theta_2 W + v_2 
$$

$$
P = \pi_1 + \pi_2 W + v_1
$$

**(b) Which structural equation is identified?**

Use the **order condition** for identification:
- **Demand equation**:
  - Contains endogenous variable  P 
  - Excludes one exogenous variable  W  ✅
  - ⇒ Identified

- **Supply equation**:
  - Includes all exogenous variables, no excluded variable ❌
  - ⇒ Not identified

✅ Conclusion: **Only the demand equation is identified**.

**(c) Indirect Least Squares (ILS)**

We are given the reduced-form estimates:

$$
\hat{Q} = 5 + 0.5 W \\
\hat{P} = 2.4 + 1 \cdot W
$$

Thus:

𝜃1=5,𝜃2=0.5 

𝜋1=2.4,𝜋2=1

Substitute values:

$$
\theta_1 = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 \pi_1 \\
\theta_2 = \alpha_2 \pi_2
$$

Use the structural-to-reduced-form parameter relations:

5=𝛼1+𝛼2(2.4)

0.5=𝛼2(1)

Substitute values:

𝛼2=0.5

𝛼1=5−0.5×2.4=3.8

✅  ILS estimates:

𝛼^1=3.8

𝛼^2=0.5

**(d) Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) Estimation of Demand Equation**

Step 1️⃣: First stage — regress \( P \sim W \)

From the reduced form:

$$
\hat{P} = \pi_1 + \pi_2 W = 2.4 + 1 \cdot W
$$

Given \( W = \{2, 3, 1, 1, 3\} \), compute:

| W | P^ |
|--------|--------------|
| 2      | 4.4          |
| 3      | 5.4          |
| 1      | 3.4          |
| 1      | 3.4          |
| 3      | 5.4          |


Step 2️⃣: Second stage — regress \( Q \sim \hat{P} \)

Given \( Q = \{4, 6, 9, 3, 8\} \), build the table:


| Q  | P^ |
|--------|--------------|
| 4      | 4.4          |
| 6      | 5.4          |
| 9      | 3.4          |
| 3      | 3.4          |
| 8      | 5.4          |

Estimate the structural model:

$$
Q = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 \hat{P} + u
$$

This second-stage OLS regression yields the 2SLS estimates of \( \alpha_1 \) and \( \alpha_2 \).  
These estimates should be consistent and close to the ILS results obtained in part (c).
