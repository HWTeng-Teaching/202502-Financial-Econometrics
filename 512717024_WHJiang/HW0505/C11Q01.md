## C11Q01

Our aim is to estimate the parameters of the simultaneous equations model:

$$
y_1 = \alpha_1 y_2 + e_1 \\
$$

$$
y_2 = \alpha_2 y_1 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + e_2
$$

We assume that \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are exogenous and uncorrelated with the error terms \( e_1 \) and \( e_2 \).

**(a)**
Solve the two structural equations for the reduced-form equation for \( y_2 \), that is,  

$$
\( y_2 = \pi_1 x_1 + \pi_2 x_2 + \nu_2 \). 
$$

Express the reduced-form parameters in terms of the **structural parameters**, and the reduced-form error in terms of \( e_1 \) and \( e_2 \).  
Show that \( y_2 \) is correlated with \( e_1 \).

**(b)**
Which equation parameters are consistently estimated using OLS? Explain.

**(c)**
Which parameters are "identified" in the simultaneous equations sense? Explain your reasoning.

**(d)**
To estimate the parameters of the reduced-form equation for \( y_2 \) using the **method of moments (MOM)**, the two moment equations are:

$$
\frac{1}{N} \sum x_{1i}(y_{2i} - \pi_1 x_{1i} - \pi_2 x_{2i}) = 0 \\
\frac{1}{N} \sum x_{2i}(y_{2i} - \pi_1 x_{1i} - \pi_2 x_{2i}) = 0
$$

Explain why these two moment conditions are a valid basis for obtaining consistent estimators of the reduced-form parameters.

**(e)**
Are the MOM estimators in part (d) the same as the OLS estimators?  
Form the sum of squared errors for \( y_2 = \pi_1 x_1 + \pi_2 x_2 + \nu_2 \), take derivatives, and show they yield the same equations.

**(f)**
Given:

$$
\( \sum x_{1i}^2 = 1 \)
\( \sum x_{2i}^2 = 1 \)
\( \sum x_{1i} x_{2i} = 0 \)
\( \sum x_{1i} y_{i} = 2 \)
\( \sum x_{1i} y_{2i} = 3 \)
\( \sum x_{2i} y_{i} = 3 \)
\( \sum x_{2i} y_{2i} = 4 \)
$$

Use the moment conditions from part (d) to solve for \( \hat{\pi}_1 = 3 \), \( \hat{\pi}_2 = 4 \).

**(g)**
The fitted value is:

$$
\hat{y}_2 = \hat{\pi}_1 x_1 + \hat{\pi}_2 x_2
$$

Explain why we can use the moment condition:

$$
\sum x_{2i} (\hat{y}_{1i} - \alpha_1 y_{2i}) = 0
$$

to consistently estimate \( \alpha_1 \), and compute the IV estimate.

**(h)**
Find the 2SLS estimate of \( \alpha_1 \) by applying OLS to:

$$
y_1 = \alpha_1 \hat{y}_2 + e_1^*
$$

Compare with the answer in (g).
