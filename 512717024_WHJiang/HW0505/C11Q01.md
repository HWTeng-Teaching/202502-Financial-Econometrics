## C11Q01

11.1 Our aim is to estimate the parameters of the simultaneous equations model
y₁ = α₁y₂ + e₁
y₂ = α₂y₁ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + e₂
We assume that x₁ and x₂ are exogenous and uncorrelated with the error terms e₁ and e₂.
a. Solve the two structural equations for the reduced-form equation for y₂, that is, y₂ = π₁x₁ + π₂x₂ + ν₂. Express the reduced-form parameters in terms of the structural parameters and the reduced-form error in terms of the structural parameters and e₁ and e₂. Show that y₂ is correlated with e₁.
b. Which equation parameters are consistently estimated using OLS? Explain.
c. Which parameters are 'identified,' in the simultaneous equations sense? Explain your reasoning.
d. To estimate the parameters of the reduced-form equation for y₂ using the method of moments (MOM), which was introduced in Section 10.3, the two moment equations are:
N⁻¹ Σ x₁ᵢ(y₂ − π₁x₁ᵢ − π₂x₂ᵢ) = 0
N⁻¹ Σ x₂ᵢ(y₂ − π₁x₁ᵢ − π₂x₂ᵢ) = 0
Explain why these two moment conditions are a valid basis for obtaining consistent estimators of the reduced-form parameters.
e. Are the MOM estimators in part (d) the same as the OLS estimators? Form the sum of squared errors function for y₂ = π₁x₁ + π₂x₂ + ν₂ and find the first derivatives. Set these to zero and show that they are equivalent to the two equations in part (d).
f. Using Σx₁ᵢ² = 1, Σx₂ᵢ² = 1, Σx₁ᵢx₂ = 0, Σx₁ᵢyᵢ = 2, Σx₁ᵢy₂ᵢ = 3, Σx₂ᵢyᵢ = 3, Σx₂ᵢy₂ᵢ = 4, and the two moment conditions in part (d) show that the MOM/OLS estimates of π₁ and π₂ are π̂₁ = 3 and π̂₂ = 4.
g. The fitted value ŷ₂ = π̂₁x₁ + π̂₂x₂. Explain why we can use the moment condition Σx₂ᵢ(ŷ₁ᵢ − α₁y₂ᵢ) = 0 as a valid basis for consistently estimating α₁. Obtain the IV estimate of α₁.
h. Find the 2SLS estimate of α₁ by applying OLS to y₁ = α₁ŷ₂ + e₁*. Compare your answer to that in part (g).
