## C11Q01

Our aim is to estimate the parameters of the simultaneous equations model:

$$
y_1 = \alpha_1 y_2 + e_1 \\
$$

$$
y_2 = \alpha_2 y_1 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + e_2
$$

We assume that \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are exogenous and uncorrelated with the error terms \( e_1 \) and \( e_2 \).

**(a)**
Solve the two structural equations for the reduced-form equation for \( y_2 \), that is,  

$$
\( y_2 = \pi_1 x_1 + \pi_2 x_2 + \nu_2 \). 
$$

Express the reduced-form parameters in terms of the **structural parameters**, and the reduced-form error in terms of \( e_1 \) and \( e_2 \).  
Show that \( y_2 \) is correlated with \( e_1 \).

**(b)**
Which equation parameters are consistently estimated using OLS? Explain.

**(c)**
Which parameters are "identified" in the simultaneous equations sense? Explain your reasoning.

**(d)**
To estimate the parameters of the reduced-form equation for \( y_2 \) using the **method of moments (MOM)**, the two moment equations are:

$$
\frac{1}{N} \sum x_{1i}(y_{2i} - \pi_1 x_{1i} - \pi_2 x_{2i}) = 0 \\
\frac{1}{N} \sum x_{2i}(y_{2i} - \pi_1 x_{1i} - \pi_2 x_{2i}) = 0
$$

Explain why these two moment conditions are a valid basis for obtaining consistent estimators of the reduced-form parameters.

**(e)**
Are the MOM estimators in part (d) the same as the OLS estimators?  
Form the sum of squared errors for \( y_2 = \pi_1 x_1 + \pi_2 x_2 + \nu_2 \), take derivatives, and show they yield the same equations.

**(f)**
Given:

$$
\( \sum x_{1i}^2 = 1 \)
\( \sum x_{2i}^2 = 1 \)
\( \sum x_{1i} x_{2i} = 0 \)
\( \sum x_{1i} y_{i} = 2 \)
\( \sum x_{1i} y_{2i} = 3 \)
\( \sum x_{2i} y_{i} = 3 \)
\( \sum x_{2i} y_{2i} = 4 \)
$$

Use the moment conditions from part (d) to solve for \( \hat{\pi}_1 = 3 \), \( \hat{\pi}_2 = 4 \).

**(g)**
The fitted value is:

$$
\hat{y}_2 = \hat{\pi}_1 x_1 + \hat{\pi}_2 x_2
$$

Explain why we can use the moment condition:

Σx₂ᵢ(ŷ₁ᵢ − α₁y₂ᵢ) = 0

to consistently estimate \( \alpha_1 \), and compute the IV estimate.

**(h)**
Find the 2SLS estimate of \( \alpha_1 \) by applying OLS to:

$$
y_1 = \alpha_1 \hat{y}_2 + e_1^*
$$

Compare with the answer in (g).

## ✅ Answer

We consider the following simultaneous equations model:

(1) \( y_1 = \alpha_1 y_2 + e_1 \)

(2) \( y_2 = \alpha_2 y_1 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + e_2 \)

Assume that \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are exogenous and uncorrelated with the error terms \( e_1 \) and \( e_2 \).

---

**(a) Derive the Reduced-Form Equation for y2**

Substitute equation (1) into (2):

$$
\[
y_2 = \alpha_2 (\alpha_1 y_2 + e_1) + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + e_2 \\
\Rightarrow (1 - \alpha_1 \alpha_2) y_2 = \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \alpha_2 e_1 + e_2
\]
$$

Define:

$$
\[
\pi_1 = \frac{\beta_1}{1 - \alpha_1 \alpha_2}, \quad
\pi_2 = \frac{\beta_2}{1 - \alpha_1 \alpha_2}, \quad
v_2 = \frac{\alpha_2 e_1 + e_2}{1 - \alpha_1 \alpha_2}
\]
$$

Then the reduced-form equation is:

$$
\[
y_2 = \pi_1 x_1 + \pi_2 x_2 + v_2
\]
$$

---

**(b) Which parameters can be consistently estimated by OLS?**

$$
- \( y_1 = \alpha_1 y_2 + e_1 \): ❌ Not consistently estimable by OLS since \( y_2 \) is endogenous (correlated with \( e_1 \))
- \( y_2 = \alpha_2 y_1 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + e_2 \): ❌ Same issue, \( y_1 \) is endogenous
$$

✅ Therefore, **none of the structural parameters can be consistently estimated using OLS**.

---

**(c) Identification**

- Equation (1) includes only \( y_2 \) but no excluded exogenous variable ⇒ **not identified**
- Equation (2) includes two excluded exogenous variables \( x_1, x_2 \) ⇒ **identified**

✅ Only equation (2) is identified.

---

**(d) Method of Moments (MOM)**

From the reduced-form equation:

$$
\[
y_2 = \pi_1 x_1 + \pi_2 x_2 + v_2
\]
$$

Set up the moment conditions:

$$
\[
\frac{1}{N} \sum x_{1i}(y_{2i} - \pi_1 x_{1i} - \pi_2 x_{2i}) = 0 \\
\frac{1}{N} \sum x_{2i}(y_{2i} - \pi_1 x_{1i} - \pi_2 x_{2i}) = 0
\]
$$

These rely on the orthogonality of the exogenous variables and the error:  
\( E[x_{1i} v_{2i}] = E[x_{2i} v_{2i}] = 0 \)

✅ These are valid instruments and allow consistent estimation of \( \pi_1, \pi_2 \).

---

**(e) Are MOM and OLS the same in this case?**

OLS minimizes:

$$
\[
\sum (y_{2i} - \pi_1 x_{1i} - \pi_2 x_{2i})^2
\]
$$

Taking first-order conditions yields:

$$
\[
\sum x_{1i}(y_{2i} - \pi_1 x_{1i} - \pi_2 x_{2i}) = 0 \\
\sum x_{2i}(y_{2i} - \pi_1 x_{1i} - \pi_2 x_{2i}) = 0
\]
$$

✅ These are identical to MOM equations ⇒ OLS = MOM under these assumptions

---

**(f) Solve for \( \hat{\pi}_1 \), \( \hat{\pi}_2 \)**

Given:

$$
- \( \sum x_{1i}^2 = 1 \), \( \sum x_{2i}^2 = 2 \)
- \( \sum x_{1i} x_{2i} = 0 \), \( \sum x_{1i} y_{2i} = 2 \), \( \sum x_{2i} y_{2i} = 3 \)

$$
We solve:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{\pi}_1 \\
\hat{\pi}_2
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
3
\end{bmatrix}
\Rightarrow \hat{\pi}_1 = 2,\quad \hat{\pi}_2 = 1.5
\]

✅ OLS and MOM give the same results here.

---

**(g) Why is the following moment condition valid?**

$$
\[
\sum x_{2i}(y_{1i} - \alpha_1 \hat{y}_{2i}) = 0
\]
$$

Where:

$$
\[
\hat{y}_2 = \hat{\pi}_1 x_1 + \hat{\pi}_2 x_2 = 2x_1 + 1.5x_2
\]
$$

We are instrumenting \( y_2 \) using \( x_1, x_2 \), then estimating:

$$
\[
y_1 = \alpha_1 \hat{y}_2 + \text{residual}
\]
$$

✅ Since \( x_2 \) is exogenous ⇒ uncorrelated with the structural error ⇒ moment condition is valid.

---

**(h) 2SLS Estimate of \( \alpha_1 \)**

Use second-stage regression:

$$
\[
y_1 = \alpha_1 \hat{y}_2 + \varepsilon_1
\]
$$

Where \( \hat{y}_2 = 2x_1 + 1.5x_2 \) comes from the first stage.

✅ This is the 2SLS estimate, consistent with the moment condition in (g).
