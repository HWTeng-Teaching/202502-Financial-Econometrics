Consumer expenditure data from 2013 are contained in the file `cex5_small`. [Note: `cex5` is a larger version with more observations and variables.]  
Data are on three-person households consisting of a husband and wife, plus one other member, with incomes between \$1000 per month to \$20,000 per month.  
`FOODAWAY` is past quarter’s food away from home expenditure per month per person, in dollars, and `INCOME` is household monthly income during past year, in \$100 units.

### Questions:

**(a)** Construct a histogram of `FOODAWAY` and its summary statistics. What are the mean and median values? What are the 25th and 75th percentiles?  
**(b)** What are the mean and median values of `FOODAWAY` for households including a member with an advanced degree? With a college degree member? With no advanced or college degree member?  
**(c)** Construct a histogram of ln(`FOODAWAY`) and its summary statistics. Explain why `FOODAWAY` and ln(`FOODAWAY`) have different numbers of observations.  
**(d)** Estimate the linear regression ln(`FOODAWAY`) = β₁ + β₂ `INCOME` + e. Interpret the estimated slope.  
**(e)** Plot ln(`FOODAWAY`) against `INCOME`, and include the fitted line from part (d).  
**(f)** Calculate the least squares residuals from the estimation in part (d). Plot them vs. `INCOME`. Do you find any unusual patterns, or do they seem completely random?

【foodway 描述性統計】
平均值 = 49.27085 
中位數 = 32.555 
第25百分位數 = 12.04 
第75百分位數 = 67.5025

【迴歸模型估計】
ln(FOODAWAY) =  3.1293  +  NA  * INCOME + e

* 當 INCOME 增加 1 單位（即100美元）時，ln(FOODAWAY) 平均變化 NA 單位。
* 這可近似解釋為 FOODAWAY 支出變化的百分比效應。
