The data file `collegetown` contains observations on 500 single-family houses sold in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, during 2009–2013. The data include sale price (in thousands of dollars), `PRICE`, and total interior area of the house in hundreds of square feet, `SQFT`.

**(a)** Scatter Diagram
Plot house price against house size in a scatter diagram.

**(b)** Linear Regression Model
Estimate the linear regression model:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`PRICE = β₁ + β₂ SQFT + e`  
Interpret the estimates. Draw a sketch of the fitted line.

**(c)** Quadratic Regression Model
Estimate the quadratic regression model:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`PRICE = α₁ + α₂ SQFT² + e`  
Compute the marginal effect of an additional 100 square feet of living area in a home with 2000 square feet of living space.

**(d)** Fitted Curve and Tangent Line
Graph the fitted curve for the model in part (c). On the graph, sketch the line that is tangent to the curve for a 2000-square-foot house.

**(e)** Elasticity Calculation
For the model in part (c), compute the elasticity of `PRICE` with respect to `SQFT` for a home with 2000 square feet of living space.

**(f)** Residual Analysis
For the regressions in (b) and (c), compute the least squares residuals and plot them against `SQFT`. Do any of our assumptions appear violated?

**(g)** Model Fit Comparison
One basis for choosing between these two specifications is how well the data are fit by the model. Compare the sum of squared residuals (SSE) from the models in (b) and (c). Which model has a lower SSE? How does having a lower SSE indicate a “better-fitting” model?

### β₂ 的估計值表示房價（千美元）每增加一個單位的 SQFT（即100平方英尺）所增加的平均金額
### β₁ 為當 SQFT = 0 時的預測房價
