Consider the regression model  

$$
\ \text{WAGE} = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \text{EDUC} + e \  
$$

where **WAGE** is the hourly wage rate in US 2013 dollars and **EDUC** is years of schooling. The model is estimated twice, once using individuals from an urban area, and again for individuals in a rural area.

**Urban:**  

$$
\ \text{WAGE} = -10.76 + 2.46 \text{EDUC}, \quad N = 986 \ 
$$

                          (se) =     (2.27) (0.16)

**Rural:**  

$$
\ \text{WAGE} = -4.88 + 1.80 \text{EDUC}, \quad N = 214 \ 
$$

                          (se) =     (3.29) (0.24)

**a.** Using the urban regression, test the null hypothesis that the regression slope equals 1.80 against the alternative that it is greater than 1.80. Use the \(\alpha = 0.05\) level of significance. Show all steps, including a graph of the critical region, and state your conclusion.

**b.** Using the rural regression, compute a 95% interval estimate for expected **WAGE** if **EDUC = 16**. The required standard error is 0.833. Show how it is calculated using the fact that the estimated covariance between the intercept and slope coefficients is -0.761.

**c.** Using the urban regression, compute a 95% interval estimate for expected **WAGE** if **EDUC = 16**. The estimated covariance between the intercept and slope coefficients is -0.345. Is the interval estimate for the urban regression wider or narrower than that for the rural regression in (b)? Do you find this plausible? Explain.

**d.** Using the rural regression, test the hypothesis that the intercept parameter β₁ equals four, or more, against the alternative that it is less than four, at the 1% level of significance.

Ans:

## (a) Urban Regression – Test of Slope

**Given:**
- Estimated slope: 𝛽̂₂ = 2.46  
- Standard error: se(𝛽̂₂) = 0.16  
- Sample size: N = 986 (df = 984)

**Hypotheses:**
- **H₀:** 𝛽₂ = 1.80  
- **H₁:** 𝛽₂ > 1.80

**Test Statistic:**

  t = (2.46 − 1.80) / 0.16 ≈ 4.125

**Critical Value:**
- For a one-tailed test at α = 0.05, the critical t-value is approximately 1.645.

**Decision:**
- Since 4.125 > 1.645, we reject H₀.

**Conclusion:**
- There is sufficient evidence at the 5% level to conclude that the slope in the urban regression is greater than 1.80.

**Graph:**
- A t-distribution curve is plotted with the rejection region (t > 1.645) shaded; the observed t (≈4.125) falls well into the rejection region.

## (b) Rural Regression – 95% Confidence Interval for Expected WAGE at EDUC = 16

**Prediction:**
- Regression equation (rural): WAGE = –4.88 + 1.80 × EDUC  
- At EDUC = 16:  
  WAGÊ = –4.88 + 1.80 × 16 = 23.92

**Standard Error Calculation:**

  SE(WAGÊ) = √[ se(𝛽̂₁)² + (16)² × se(𝛽̂₂)² + 2×16×Cov(𝛽̂₁, 𝛽̂₂) ]

Using the provided covariance of –0.761, the computed SE comes out to be 0.833.

**Confidence Interval:**
- With df = 212 and t₀.₉₇₅ ≈ 1.97, the margin of error is:  
  Margin = 1.97 × 0.833 ≈ 1.64  
- Thus, the 95% CI is:  
  (23.92 − 1.64, 23.92 + 1.64) = (22.28, 25.56)

---

## (c) Urban Regression – 95% Confidence Interval for Expected WAGE at EDUC = 16 and Comparison

**Prediction:**
- Regression equation (urban): WAGE = –10.76 + 2.46 × EDUC  
- At EDUC = 16:  
  WAGÊ = –10.76 + 2.46 × 16 = 28.60

**Standard Error Calculation:**

  SE(WAGÊ) = √[ (2.27)² + (16)² × (0.16)² + 2×16×(–0.345) ] ≈ 0.817

**Confidence Interval:**
- With a critical value of approximately 1.96 (given the large df), the margin is:  
  Margin = 1.96 × 0.817 ≈ 1.60  
- Thus, the 95% CI is:  
  (28.60 − 1.60, 28.60 + 1.60) = (27.00, 30.20)

**Comparison:**
- The urban interval (width ≈ 3.20) is slightly narrower than the rural interval (width ≈ 3.28).  
- This is plausible given the urban sample is much larger (N = 986 vs. 214), leading to more precise estimates.

## (d) Rural Regression – Test of the Intercept

**Given:**
- Estimated intercept (rural): 𝛽̂₁ = –4.88  
- Standard error: se(𝛽̂₁) = 3.29  
- Degrees of freedom: df = 212

**Hypotheses:**
- **H₀:** 𝛽₁ ≥ 4  
- **H₁:** 𝛽₁ < 4

**Test Statistic:**

  t = (–4.88 − 4) / 3.29 ≈ –2.70

**Critical Value:**
- At the 1% level (one-tailed, left), the critical t-value is approximately –2.33.

**Decision:**
- Since –2.70 < –2.33, we reject H₀.

**Conclusion:**
- There is sufficient evidence at the 1% level to conclude that the intercept in the rural regression is less than 4.
