Consider the regression model  

$$
\ \text{WAGE} = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \text{EDUC} + e \  
$$

where **WAGE** is the hourly wage rate in US 2013 dollars and **EDUC** is years of schooling. The model is estimated twice, once using individuals from an urban area, and again for individuals in a rural area.

**Urban:**  

$$
\ \text{WAGE} = -10.76 + 2.46 \text{EDUC}, \quad N = 986 \ 
$$

                          (se) =     (2.27) (0.16)

**Rural:**  

$$
\ \text{WAGE} = -4.88 + 1.80 \text{EDUC}, \quad N = 214 \ 
$$

                          (se) =     (3.29) (0.24)

**a.** Using the urban regression, test the null hypothesis that the regression slope equals 1.80 against the alternative that it is greater than 1.80. Use the \(\alpha = 0.05\) level of significance. Show all steps, including a graph of the critical region, and state your conclusion.

**b.** Using the rural regression, compute a 95% interval estimate for expected **WAGE** if **EDUC = 16**. The required standard error is 0.833. Show how it is calculated using the fact that the estimated covariance between the intercept and slope coefficients is -0.761.

**c.** Using the urban regression, compute a 95% interval estimate for expected **WAGE** if **EDUC = 16**. The estimated covariance between the intercept and slope coefficients is -0.345. Is the interval estimate for the urban regression wider or narrower than that for the rural regression in (b)? Do you find this plausible? Explain.

**d.** Using the rural regression, test the hypothesis that the intercept parameter \(\beta_1\) equals four, or more, against the alternative that it is less than four, at the 1% level of significance.
