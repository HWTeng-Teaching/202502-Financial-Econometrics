There were 64 countries in 1992 that competed in the Olympics and won at least one medal. Let **MEDALS** be the total number of medals won, and let **GDPB** be GDP (billions of 1995 dollars). A linear regression model explaining the number of medals won is:

$$
\ \text{MEDALS} = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \text{GDPB} + e \
$$

The estimated relationship is:

$$
\ \text{MEDALS} = b_1 + b_2 \text{GDPB} \ = 7.61733 + 0.01309 \text{GDPB} \
$$

                        (se)                    (2.38994) (0.00215)   (XR3.1)

**a.** We wish to test the hypothesis that there is no relationship between the number of medals won and GDP against the alternative there is a positive relationship. State the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the model parameters.

**b.** What is the test statistic for part (a) and what is its distribution if the null hypothesis is true?

**c.** What happens to the distribution of the test statistic for part (a) if the alternative hypothesis is true? Is the distribution shifted to the left or right, relative to the usual t-distribution? [Hint: What is the expected value of \( b_2 \) if the null hypothesis is true, and what is it if the alternative is true?]

**d.** For a test at the 1% level of significance, for what values of the t-statistic will we reject the null hypothesis in part (a)? For what values will we fail to reject the null hypothesis?

**e.** Carry out the t-test for the null hypothesis in part (a) at the 1% level of significance. What is your economic conclusion? What does 1% level of significance mean in this example?

### Ans:

**(a)** 
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀): β₂ = 0**, GDP has no effect on the number of medals.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): β₂ > 0**, GDP has a positive effect on the number of medals.

## (b) Test Statistic and its Distribution
- **Test Statistic Formula:**

  t = (b₂ − 0) / se(b₂)
  
- **Substituting the Values:**

  t = 0.01309 / 0.00215 ≈ 6.086

- **Distribution:**  
  Under the null hypothesis (β₂ = 0), the test statistic follows a t-distribution with n - 2 degrees of freedom. Here, n = 64, so the degrees of freedom are 64 - 2 = 62.

## (c) Distribution Under the Alternative Hypothesis
When the alternative hypothesis (β₂ > 0) holds, the expected value of b₂ is greater than 0. Consequently, the test statistic t follows a noncentral t-distribution with a positive noncentrality parameter. This distribution is shifted to the right compared to the central t-distribution, meaning most of the probability mass lies at larger t values.

## (d) Critical Values at the 1% Significance Level
- Since this is a one-tailed (right-tailed) test at the 1% significance level, we refer to the 99th percentile of the t-distribution.
- For a t-distribution with 62 degrees of freedom, the critical t-value (t₀.₉₉) is approximately 2.39.
  - **Rejection Region:** t > 2.39 (reject H₀)
  - **Non-Rejection Region:** t ≤ 2.39 (fail to reject H₀)

## (e) Conducting the t-Test and Economic Implication
- **Calculation:**  
  The computed t-value is approximately 6.086, which is significantly greater than the critical value of 2.39.
  
- **Test Conclusion:**  
  At the 1% significance level, we reject the null hypothesis H₀.

- **Economic Implication:**  
  There is statistically significant evidence that GDP positively affects the number of medals. This means that countries with higher GDP tend to win more medals.

- **Interpretation of the 1% Significance Level:**  
  The 1% significance level implies that there is only a 1% probability of committing a Type I error (i.e., incorrectly rejecting the true null hypothesis), indicating a very strict standard for detecting a significant effect.
