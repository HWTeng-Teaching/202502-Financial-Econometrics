**a.** Using the information provided, calculate the estimated intercept. Show your work.

**b.** Sketch the estimated relationship. Is it increasing or decreasing? Is it a positive or inverse relationship? Is it increasing or decreasing at a constant rate or is it increasing or decreasing at an increasing rate?

**c.** Using the information provided, calculate the standard error of the slope coefficient. Show your work.

**d.** What is the value of the t-statistic for the null hypothesis that the intercept parameter equals 10?

**e.** The p-value for a two-tail test that the intercept parameter equals 10, from part (d), is 0.572. Show the p-value in a sketch. On the sketch, show the rejection region if α = 0.05.

**f.** Construct a 99% interval estimate of the slope. Interpret the interval estimate.

**g.** Test the null hypothesis that the slope coefficient is one against the alternative that it is not one at the 5% level of significance. State the economic result of the test, in the context of this problem.
