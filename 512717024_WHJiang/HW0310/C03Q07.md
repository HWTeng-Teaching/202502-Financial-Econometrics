We have 2008 data on **INCOME** = income per capita (in thousands of dollars) and **BACHELOR** = percentage of the population with a bachelor’s degree or more for the 50 U.S. States plus the District of Columbia, a total of N = 51 observations. The results from a simple linear regression of INCOME on BACHELOR are:

INCOME = (a) + 1.029 BACHELOR

    se =   (2.672)  (c)

    t =    (4.31)  (10.75)

**a.** Using the information provided, calculate the estimated intercept. Show your work.

**b.** Sketch the estimated relationship. Is it increasing or decreasing? Is it a positive or inverse relationship? Is it increasing or decreasing at a constant rate or is it increasing or decreasing at an increasing rate?

**c.** Using the information provided, calculate the standard error of the slope coefficient. Show your work.

**d.** What is the value of the t-statistic for the null hypothesis that the intercept parameter equals 10?

**e.** The p-value for a two-tail test that the intercept parameter equals 10, from part (d), is 0.572. Show the p-value in a sketch. On the sketch, show the rejection region if α = 0.05.

**f.** Construct a 99% interval estimate of the slope. Interpret the interval estimate.

### Ans:

**(a)**
The regression equation is:

  INCOME = (a) + 1.029 × BACHELOR  
The provided t-value for the intercept is 4.31 with a standard error of 2.672.  
Using the formula:  
  t = (estimated intercept − 0) / standard error  
Thus, estimated intercept = t × standard error = 4.31 × 2.672 ≈ 11.51632  

* The estimated intercept is approximately 11.53.

**(b)**
The estimated regression is:
  INCOME = 11.53 + 1.029 × BACHELOR

**Interpretation:**  
Since the slope (1.029) is positive, as BACHELOR increases, INCOME increases.  
This indicates a positive relationship. Being a linear model, the rate of increase is constant.

**Sketch Concept:**  
Plot a straight line with the horizontal axis representing BACHELOR and the vertical axis representing INCOME, starting at approximately 11.53 and rising by about 1.029 units for every one-unit increase in BACHELOR.

## (c) Standard Error of the Slope Coefficient
Given slope = 1.029 and its t-value = 10.75, use the formula:  
  t = (slope − 0) / standard error  
Thus, standard error = slope / t = 1.029 / 10.75 ≈ 0.0958  

**Answer (c):** The standard error of the slope is approximately 0.0958.

## (d) t-Statistic for Testing Intercept = 10
Under the null hypothesis, intercept = 10. The estimated intercept is approximately 11.53 with a standard error of 2.672.  
Calculation:  
  t = (11.53 − 10) / 2.672 ≈ 1.53 / 2.672 ≈ 0.572  

**Answer (d):** The t-statistic is approximately 0.572.

## (e) Sketch of the p-Value and Rejection Region (α = 0.05)
For the two-tailed test that the intercept equals 10, the p-value is given as 0.572.

**Sketch Explanation:**  
- Draw a t-distribution curve centered at 0.  
- Mark the critical values (for example, for df ≈ 49, the critical t-values are approximately ±2.01 at a 5% significance level).  
- Shade the areas in the two tails corresponding to the p-value of 0.572 (which lie within the acceptance region, not in the extreme tails).

**Answer (e):** The p-value area is the combined area in both tails beyond t = ±0.572, and since the rejection regions are for t < −2.01 or t > 2.01, the observed t-value falls well within the acceptance region.
