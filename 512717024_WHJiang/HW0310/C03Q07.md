We have 2008 data on **INCOME** = income per capita (in thousands of dollars) and **BACHELOR** = percentage of the population with a bachelor’s degree or more for the 50 U.S. States plus the District of Columbia, a total of N = 51 observations. The results from a simple linear regression of INCOME on BACHELOR are:

INCOME = (a) + 1.029 BACHELOR

    se =   (2.672)  (c)

    t =    (4.31)  (10.75)

**a.** Using the information provided, calculate the estimated intercept. Show your work.

**b.** Sketch the estimated relationship. Is it increasing or decreasing? Is it a positive or inverse relationship? Is it increasing or decreasing at a constant rate or is it increasing or decreasing at an increasing rate?

**c.** Using the information provided, calculate the standard error of the slope coefficient. Show your work.

### Ans:

**(a)**
The regression equation is:

  INCOME = (a) + 1.029 × BACHELOR  
The provided t-value for the intercept is 4.31 with a standard error of 2.672.  
Using the formula:  
  t = (estimated intercept − 0) / standard error  
Thus, estimated intercept = t × standard error = 4.31 × 2.672 ≈ 11.51632  

* The estimated intercept is approximately 11.53.

**(b)**
The estimated regression is:

  INCOME = 11.53 + 1.029 × BACHELOR

**Interpretation:**  
Since the slope (1.029) is positive, as BACHELOR increases, INCOME increases.  
This indicates a positive relationship. Being a linear model, the rate of increase is constant.

**Sketch Concept:**  
Plot a straight line with the horizontal axis representing BACHELOR and the vertical axis representing INCOME, starting at approximately 11.53 and rising by about 1.029 units for every one-unit increase in BACHELOR.

**(c)**
Given slope = 1.029 and its t-value = 10.75, use the formula:  

  t = (slope − 0) / standard error  
Thus, standard error = slope / t = 1.029 / 10.75 ≈ 0.0957  

* The standard error of the slope is approximately 0.0958.

**(d)**
Under the null hypothesis, intercept = 10. The estimated intercept is approximately 11.53 with a standard error of 2.672.  
Calculation:  
  t = (11.5163 − 10) / 2.672 ≈ 0.567 

*The t-statistic is approximately 0.567.

**(e)**

* the rejection regions are for t < −2.01 or t > 2.01, the observed t-value falls well within the acceptance region.


**(f)**
The 99.5 Percentile of t(49) distribution: 2.68

The 99% interval estimated for the slope :

$$
\ b_2 ± t_c se(b_2) = 1.029 ± 2.68(0.0957) = [0.7725,1.2855].\
$$

**(g)** 

**Hypotheses:**
- **Null Hypothesis \(H_0\):** \(\beta_2 = 1\)
- **Alternative Hypothesis \(H_a\):** \(\beta_2 \neq 1\)

**Test Statistic:**
\[
t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_2 - 1}{\mathrm{SE}(\hat{\beta}_2)}
\]
Under \(H_0\), this statistic follows a \(t\)-distribution with \(n - 2\) degrees of freedom.

**Critical Value:**
- For a two-tailed test at the 5% significance level (\(\alpha = 0.05\)), the relevant percentiles are \(\pm t_{(0.975,\,49)}\).
- The 97.5th percentile of the \(t_{(49)}\) distribution is approximately 2.009, so we reject \(H_0\) if
  \[
  t \ge 2.009 \quad \text{or} \quad t \le -2.009.
  \]

**Calculation:**
\[
\hat{\beta}_2 = 1.029, 
\quad 
\mathrm{SE}(\hat{\beta}_2) = 0.0957,
\quad 
t = \frac{1.029 - 1}{0.0957} \approx 0.303.
\]

**Conclusion:**
Because \(|0.303| < 2.009\), we fail to reject \(H_0\).  
There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the slope differs from 1, implying we cannot reject the hypothesis that each additional 1% of the population with a bachelor’s degree increases per capita income by \$1000.
