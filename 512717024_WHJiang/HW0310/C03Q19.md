The owners of a motel discovered that a defective product was used during construction. It took 7 months to correct the defects during which approximately 14 rooms in the 100-unit motel were taken out of service for 1 month at a time. The data are in the file `motel`.

**a.** Plot `MOTEL_PCT` and `COMP_PCT` versus `TIME` on the same graph. What can you say about the occupancy rates over time? Do they tend to move together? Which seems to have the higher occupancy rates? Estimate the regression model MOTEL_PCT = β₁ + β₂ COMP_PCT + e. Construct a 95% interval estimate for the parameter β₂. Have we estimated the association between `MOTEL_PCT` and `COMP_PCT` relatively precisely, or not? Explain your reasoning.

**b.** Construct a 90% interval estimate of the expected occupancy rate of the motel in question, `MOTEL_PCT`, given that `COMP_PCT = 70`.

**c.** In the linear regression model MOTEL_PCT = β₁ + β₂ COMP_PCT + e, test the null hypothesis H0: β₂ ≦ 0 against the alternative hypothesis Ha: β₂ > 0 at the α = 0.01 level of significance. Discuss your conclusion. Clearly define the test statistic used and the rejection region.

**d.** In the linear regression model MOTEL_PCT = β₁ + β₂ COMP_PCT + e, test the null hypothesis H0: β₂ = 1 against the alternative hypothesis Ha: β₂ ≠ 1 at the α = 0.01 level of significance. If the null hypothesis were true, what would that imply about the motel’s occupancy rate versus their competitor’s occupancy rate? Discuss your conclusion. Clearly define the test statistic used and the rejection region.

**e.** Calculate the least squares residuals from the regression of `MOTEL_PCT` on `COMP_PCT` and plot them against `TIME`. Are there any unusual features to the plot? What is the predominant sign of the residuals during time periods 17–23 (July 2004 to January 2005)?

### Plotting and Trend Analysis
- **Plot the Data:**  
  Plot the two variables, **MOTEL_PCT** and **COMP_PCT**, against **TIME** on the same graph.
- **Visual Comparison:**  
  By visually comparing the curves, you can determine whether the occupancy rates move together over time.  
  - If both series follow a similar pattern (for example, both rising or falling simultaneously), it suggests that external factors (such as seasonality) affect them similarly.
  - Observe which series tends to have higher occupancy; for instance, the competitor’s occupancy might consistently be higher than the motel’s.

  Estimate the regression model:
MOTEL_PCT = β₁ + β₂ COMP_PCT + e

- **Parameter Estimates:**  
Obtain the estimates **β̂₁** and **β̂₂** along with the standard error for **β̂₂**.

### 95% Confidence Interval for β₂
- **Interval Formula:**  
The confidence interval is given by:

β̂₂ ± t(0.975, df) × SE(β̂₂)


- **Interpretation:**  
A narrow confidence interval indicates that the association between **MOTEL_PCT** and **COMP_PCT** has been estimated precisely, whereas a wide interval suggests a high level of uncertainty in the estimate.

## (b) 90% Confidence Interval for Expected MOTEL_PCT at COMP_PCT = 70

### Prediction
- **Calculate the Predicted Value:**  
Use the estimated regression model to predict **MOTEL_PCT** when **COMP_PCT = 70**:

MOTEL_PCT^ = β̂₁ + β̂₂ × 70

### Constructing the Interval
- **Confidence Interval Formula:**  
The 90% confidence interval for the expected value is:

MOTEL_PCT^ ± t(0.95, df) × SE(MOTEL_PCT^)


where **SE(MOTEL_PCT^)** is the standard error of the prediction.
- **Interpretation:**  
This interval provides the range within which we are 90% confident that the true mean occupancy rate will fall when **COMP_PCT** is 70.

## (c) Testing H₀: β₂ ≤ 0 vs. Hₐ: β₂ > 0

### Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** β₂ ≤ 0  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** β₂ > 0

### Test Statistic
- **Calculation:**  
Compute the t-statistic as:

t = (β̂₂ − 0) / SE(β̂₂)


### Rejection Region
- For a one-tailed test at **α = 0.01**, reject H₀ if:

t > t(0.99, df)


### Conclusion
- If the computed t-statistic exceeds the critical value, you reject H₀ and conclude that there is statistically significant evidence at the 1% level that the association between **COMP_PCT** and **MOTEL_PCT** is positive.

---

## (d) Testing H₀: β₂ = 1 vs. Hₐ: β₂ ≠ 1

### Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** β₂ = 1  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** β₂ ≠ 1

### Test Statistic
- **Calculation:**  
Compute the t-statistic as:

t = (β̂₂ − 1) / SE(β̂₂)


### Rejection Region
- For a two-tailed test at **α = 0.01**, reject H₀ if:

|t| > t(0.995, df)


### Interpretation
- If H₀ were true (β₂ = 1), it would imply a one-for-one relationship between competitor occupancy and the motel’s occupancy (i.e., a 1 percentage point increase in **COMP_PCT** would lead to a 1 percentage point increase in **MOTEL_PCT**).
- If the t-statistic falls in the rejection region, conclude that the relationship deviates significantly from one-for-one.

## (e) Residual Analysis

### Calculation of Residuals
- **Residual Formula:**  
For each observation, calculate the residual as:

eᵢ = MOTEL_PCTᵢ − (β̂₁ + β̂₂ COMP_PCTᵢ)


### Plotting vs. TIME
- **Purpose:**  
Plot these residuals against **TIME** to check for any systematic patterns.
- **Ideal Pattern:**  
Ideally, the residuals should be randomly scattered around zero, indicating a good model fit.

### Examination of Time Periods 17–23
- **Focus Period:**  
Analyze the residuals from **TIME periods 17–23** (from July 2004 to January 2005).
- **Interpretation:**  
Determine whether the majority of the residuals in this period are positive or negative.  
- For example, if most residuals are negative, it suggests that the actual motel occupancy was lower than predicted by the regression model during these months—possibly due to disruptions such as construction defect corrections.
