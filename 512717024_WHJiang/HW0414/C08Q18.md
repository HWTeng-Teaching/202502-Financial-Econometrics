### C08Q18

Consider the wage equation:

ln(WAGEᵢ) = β₁ + β₂EDUCᵢ + β₃EXPERᵢ + β₄EXPERᵢ² + β₅FEMALEᵢ + β₆BLACKᵢ + β₇METROᵢ + β₈SOUTHᵢ + β₉MIDWESTᵢ + β₁₀WESTᵢ + eᵢ

where WAGE is measured in dollars per hour, education and experience are in years, and METRO = 1 if the person lives in a metropolitan area. Use 
the data file cps5 for the exercise.

a. We are curious whether holding education, experience, and METRO equal, there is the same amount of random variation in wages for males and females. Suppose var(eᵢ|xᵢ, FEMALE = 0) = σ²M and var(eᵢ|xᵢ, FEMALE = 1) = σ²F. We specifically wish to test the null hypothesis σ²M = σ²F against σ²M ≠ σ²F. Carry out a Goldfeld–Quandt test of the null hypothesis at the 5% level of significance. Clearly state the value of the test statistic and the rejection region, along with your conclusion.

b. Estimate the model by OLS. Carry out the NR² test using the right-hand-side variables METRO, FEMALE, BLACK as candidates related to the heteroskedasticity. What do we conclude about heteroskedasticity, at the 1% level? Do these results support your conclusions in (a)? Repeat the test using all model explanatory variables as candidates related to the heteroskedasticity.

c. Carry out the White test for heteroskedasticity. What is the 5% critical value for the test? What do you conclude?

d. Estimate the model by OLS with White heteroskedasticity robust standard errors. Compared to OLS with conventional standard errors, for which coefficients have interval estimates gotten narrower? For which coefficients have interval estimates gotten wider? Is there an inconsistency in the results?

e. Obtain FGLS estimates using candidate variables METRO and EXPER. How do the interval estimates compare to OLS with robust standard errors, from part (d)?

f. Obtain FGLS estimates with robust standard errors using candidate variables METRO and EXPER. How do the interval estimates compare to those in part (e) and OLS with robust standard errors, from part (d)?

g. If reporting the results of this model in a research paper which one set of estimates would you present? Explain your choice.

## (a) Goldfeld–Quandt Test: Testing Error Variance Equality between Males and Females

**Hypotheses:**

- H₀: σ²_M = σ²_F (Homoskedasticity)
- H₁: σ²_M ≠ σ²_F (Heteroskedasticity)

**Calculation Results:**

| Item                | Value             |
|---------------------|------------------|
| SSE (Male)          | 1208.99          |
| SSE (Female)        | 925.18           |
| F Statistic         | **1.0538**       |
| Degrees of Freedom  | (5419, 4370)     |
| Critical Values     | [0.9453, 1.0581] |

**Conclusion:**  
F = 1.0538 lies **within** the non-rejection region (0.9453 < 1.0538 < 1.0581).  
→ **Fail to reject H₀**.  
No evidence of different error variances between males and females at the 5% significance level.

## (b) NR² Test: Testing for Heteroskedasticity Related to Specific Variables

Variables: METRO, FEMALE, BLACK

**Hypotheses:**

- H₀: Errors are not related to these variables (homoskedasticity)
- H₁: Errors are related to at least one of them (heteroskedasticity)

**Test Results:**

| Item             | Value      |
|------------------|------------|
| Sample Size (n)  | 9799       |
| R² from residual regression | 0.0024 |
| NR² Statistic    | **23.5568**|
| χ² Critical Value (α = 0.01) | **11.3449** |

**Conclusion:**  
Since NR² = 23.5568 > 11.3449 → **Reject H₀**.  
Errors are significantly related to METRO, FEMALE, or BLACK → **Evidence of heteroskedasticity**.

## (c) White Test for General Heteroskedasticity

**Hypotheses:**

- H₀: Constant error variance (homoskedasticity)
- H₁: Non-constant error variance (heteroskedasticity)

**Test Results:**

| Metric        | Value         |
|---------------|---------------|
| R²            | 0.0198        |
| NR² Statistic | 194.4447      |
| F Statistic   | 4.4880        |
| F p-value     | **0.0001076** |

**Conclusion:**  
p < 0.01 → **Reject H₀**.  
Model exhibits **clear heteroskedasticity**. Recommend using robust SE or FGLS.

**Conclusion:**  
Robust SE corrects for heteroskedasticity.  
Increases or decreases are modest but improve inference reliability.

## (g) Summary: Recommended Estimation Method

| Method               | Pros                                              | Cons                                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| OLS                  | Simple and interpretable, efficient under homoskedasticity | Biased inference under heteroskedasticity              |
| OLS + Robust SE      | Corrects SE under heteroskedasticity             | Less efficient estimates                               |

| FGLS + Robust SE ✅   | Combines efficiency and robustness                | More complex, needs variance modeling                  |

**Recommendation:**  
**FGLS + Robust SE** is preferred due to its robustness and efficiency, especially in presence of heteroskedasticity as indicated by tests in parts (b) and (c).
