### C08Q16

A sample of 200 Chicago households was taken to investigate how far American households tend to travel when they take a vacation. Consider the 
model:

MILES = β₁ + β₂INCOME + β₃AGE + β₄KIDS + e

MILES is miles driven per year, INCOME is measured in $1000 units, AGE is the average age of the adult members of the household, and KIDS is the number of children.

a. Use the data file vacation to estimate the model by OLS. Construct a 95% interval estimate for the effect of one more child on miles traveled, holding the two other variables constant.

b. Plot the OLS residuals versus INCOME and AGE. Do you observe any patterns suggesting that heteroskedasticity is present?

c. Sort the data according to increasing magnitude of income. Estimate the model using the first 90 observations and again using the last 90 observations. Carry out the Goldfeld–Quandt test for heteroskedastic errors at the 5% level. State the null and alternative hypotheses.

d. Estimate the model by OLS using heteroskedasticity robust standard errors. Construct a 95% interval estimate for the effect of one more child on miles traveled, holding the two other variables constant. How does this interval estimate compare to the one in (a)?

e. Obtain GLS estimates assuming σ²ᵢ = σ²INCOMEᵢ². Using both conventional GLS and robust GLS standard errors, construct a 95% interval estimate for the effect of one more child on miles traveled, holding the two other variables constant. How do these interval estimates compare to the ones in (a) and (d)?

### Ans:

# Model Specification:

$$
\text{MILES}_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \text{INCOME}_i + \beta_3 \text{AGE}_i + \beta_4 \text{KIDS}_i + e_i
$$

**(a)** 

OLS Regression and Confidence Interval Estimation

**Regression Result (Focus on KIDS variable):**

- Estimated Coefficient (β̂₄): **-81.826**
- Standard Error (SE): **27.130**
- t test = **1.97214**
- 95% Confidence Interval:
  \[
  [-135.3298, -28.32302]
  \]

**Conclusion:**

Controlling for INCOME and AGE, each additional child is associated with a reduction of approximately **81.826 miles** in annual travel distance. This estimate is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, as the confidence interval does not include 0.

Graphical Check for Heteroskedasticity: Residual Plots

### 1. Residuals vs INCOME
### 2. Residuals vs AGE

**Observations:**

- **Residuals vs INCOME:**  
  Residuals show greater variation and a funnel-like pattern at higher income levels, suggesting **possible heteroskedasticity**.

- **Residuals vs AGE:**  
  Residuals are relatively evenly spread but include some outliers.

**Conclusion:**

The plot indicates a widening variation of residuals with income, suggesting **potential heteroskedasticity** in the regression model. This pattern is not obvious with AGE, implying the issue is related to INCOME rather than AGE.



**(c)** 

Goldfeld–Quandt Test for Heteroskedasticity

**Test Steps:**

1. Sort the sample by INCOME
2. Split into the lowest 90 and highest 90 observations
3. Perform OLS for each group and compute SSE
4. Compute F-statistic:

**Results Summary:**

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| SSE (Low income group) | 101744.65 |
| SSE (High income group) | 315821.55 |
| F statistic | **3.104** |
| Critical Value (α = 0.05, df₁ = 86, df₂ = 86) | **1.4286** |

**Hypotheses:**

- H₀: σ²₁ = σ²₂ (Equal variance)
- H₁: σ²₂ > σ²₁ (Heteroskedasticity, higher variance in high-income group)

**Conclusion:**

Since \( F = 3.104 > 1.4286 \), **reject H₀**.  
At the 5% significance level, we have sufficient evidence to suggest **heteroskedasticity** exists in the model.

Re-estimation Using White Robust Standard Errors

**Model Result (KIDS):**

- Estimate (β̂₄): **-81.826**
- Robust Standard Error (HC1): **29.154**
- 95% Confidence Interval:
  \[
  [-138.969, -24.684]
  \]

**Comparison:**

| Model        | Estimate | SE     | 95% Confidence Interval      |
|--------------|----------|--------|------------------------------|
| OLS (a)      | -81.826  | 27.130 | [-135.329, -28.323]          |
| Robust OLS   | -81.826  | 29.154 | [-138.969, -24.684]          |

**Conclusion:**

- **Same estimate**: Model is unchanged
- **Larger SE**: Robust SE accounts for heteroskedasticity
- **Wider CI**: Reflects more conservative and accurate inference



**(e)** 

GLS and Robust GLS Estimation: Assuming Var(eᵢ) = σ²·INCOMEᵢ²

Assume:

$$
\text{Var}(e_i) = \sigma^2 \cdot \text{INCOME}_i^2
$$

Apply **Generalized Least Squares (GLS)** and **Robust SE (HC1)** for improved inference.

**KIDS Variable Results:**

| Model        | Estimate | SE      | 95% Confidence Interval      |
|--------------|----------|---------|------------------------------|
| OLS (a)      | -81.826  | 27.130  | [-135.329, -28.323]          |
| Robust OLS   | -81.826  | 29.154  | [-138.969, -24.684]          |
| GLS          | -76.806  | 21.848  | [-119.894, -33.718]          |
| Robust GLS   | -76.806  | 22.618  | [-121.139, -32.474]          |

**Interpretation:**

- GLS estimate is slightly smaller than OLS due to weighting (1/INCOME²)
- GLS SE is smaller → more efficient inference
- Confidence intervals are narrower in GLS and Robust GLS, indicating more precise estimates
