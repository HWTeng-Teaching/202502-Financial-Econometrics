# C11Q30 

Example 11.3 introduces Klein’s Model I

Use the data file `klein` to answer the following questions.

**a.** Estimate the investment function in equation (11.18) by OLS. Comment on the signs and significance of the coefficients.

**b.** Estimate the reduced-form equation for profits, \(P_t\), using all eight exogenous and predetermined variables as explanatory variables. Test the joint significance of all the variables except lagged profits, \(P_{t-1}\), and lagged capital stock, \(K_{t-1}\). Save the residuals, \(\hat v_t\), and compute the fitted values, \(\hat P_t\).

**c.** Do the Hausman test for the presence of endogenous explanatory variables by adding the reduced-form residuals to the structural equation and testing whether their coefficient is zero.

**d.** Obtain the 2SLS estimates of the investment equation using all eight exogenous and predetermined variables as instruments and software designed for 2SLS. Compare the estimates to the OLS estimates in part (a).

**e.** Estimate the second-stage model
\[
I_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \,\hat P_t + \beta_3 \,P_{t-1} + \beta_4 \,K_{t-1} + e_t
\]
by OLS and compare the estimates and standard errors with those in part (d).

**f.** Use the 2SLS residuals from part (e) to run the Sargan test of over-identifying restrictions. Compare the value of the test statistic \(T R^2\) with the 95% critical value of a \(\chi^2(4)\) distribution and interpret the result.

## Ans:

Use the data file `klein` to answer the following questions.

**a.** Estimate the investment function in equation (11.18) by OLS. Comment on the signs and significance of the coefficients.

> **Answer (a)**  
> \[
> I_t = 10.13 + 0.48\,P_t + 0.33\,P_{t-1} - 0.11\,K_{t-1}.
> \]  
> All coefficient signs are economically sensible; all except the constant term are highly significant.

**b.** Estimate the reduced-form equation for profits, \(P_t\), using all eight exogenous and predetermined variables as explanatory variables. Test the joint significance of all the variables except lagged profits, \(P_{t-1}\), and lagged capital stock, \(K_{t-1}\). Save the residuals, \(\hat v_t\), and compute the fitted values, \(\hat P_t\).

> **Answer (b)**  
> \(R^2 = 0.83\).  
> Joint F-test for \(G, W^2, TX, TIME, E_{t-1}\): \(p = 0.16\) ⇒ not jointly significant.  
> Residuals \(\hat v_t\) and fitted values \(\hat P_t\) have been saved.

---

**c.** Do the Hausman test for the presence of endogenous explanatory variables by adding the reduced-form residuals to the structural equation and testing whether their coefficient is zero.

> **Answer (c)**  
> Coefficient on \(\hat v_t = 0.57\) \((t = 4.03, p = 0.001)\) ⇒ reject exogeneity; \(P_t\) is endogenous.

---

**d.** Obtain the 2SLS estimates of the investment equation using all eight exogenous and predetermined variables as instruments. Compare the estimates to the OLS estimates in part (a).

> **Answer (d)**  
> \(\hat\beta_{P_t} = 0.15\) (insignificant),  
> \(\hat\beta_{P_{t-1}} = 0.62\),  
> \(\hat\beta_{K_{t-1}} = -0.16\).  
> OLS overstated the impact of current profits.

---

**e.** Estimate the second-stage model
\[
I_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \,\hat P_t + \beta_3 \,P_{t-1} + \beta_4 \,K_{t-1} + e_t
\]
by OLS and compare the estimates and standard errors with those in part (d).

> **Answer (e)**  
> OLS on \(\hat P_t\) reproduces identical point estimates but yields smaller (and incorrect) standard errors. Use the 2SLS results from part (d) for inference.

---

**f.** Use the 2SLS residuals from part (e) to run the Sargan test of over-identifying restrictions. Compare the value of the test statistic \(T R^2\) with the 95% critical value of a \(\chi^2(4)\) distribution and interpret the result.

> **Answer (f)**  
> \(T R^2 = 1.28 < \chi^2_{0.95}(4) = 9.49\).  
> Cannot reject the validity of the surplus instruments; over-identifying restrictions hold.
