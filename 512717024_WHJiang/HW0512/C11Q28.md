Supply and demand curves as traditionally drawn in economics principles classes have price (𝑃) on the vertical axis and quantity (𝑄) on the horizontal axis.

**a.** Rewrite the truffle demand and supply equations in (11.11) and (11.12) with price 𝑃 on the left-hand side. What are the anticipated signs of the parameters in this rewritten system of equations?

**b.** Using the data in the file `truffles`, estimate the supply and demand equations that you have formulated in (a) using **two-stage least squares**. Are the signs correct? Are the estimated coefficients significantly different from zero?

**c.** Estimate the price elasticity of demand “at the means” using the results from (b).

**d.** Accurately sketch the supply and demand equations, with 𝑃 on the vertical axis and 𝑄 on the horizontal axis, using the estimates from part (b). For these sketches set the values of the exogenous variables 𝐷𝐼, 𝑃𝑆, and 𝑃𝐹 to be  
\[
DI^* = 3.5,\quad PF^* = 23,\quad PS^* = 22.
\]

**e.** What are the equilibrium values of 𝑃 and 𝑄 obtained in part (d)? Calculate the predicted equilibrium values of 𝑃 and 𝑄 using the estimated reduced-form equations from Table 11.2, using the same values of the exogenous variables. How well do they agree?

**f.** Estimate the supply and demand equations that you have formulated in (a) using **OLS**. Are the signs correct? Are the estimated coefficients significantly different from zero? Compare the results to those in part (b).

## Ans:

## (a) Re-expressed System

**Demand:**  
\[
P_i = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 Q_i + \gamma_2 DI_i + \gamma_3 PS_i + \gamma_4 PF_i + u_{d,i},
\quad \gamma_1 < 0
\]

**Supply:**  
\[
P_i = \delta_0 + \delta_1 Q_i + \delta_2 PF_i + u_{s,i},
\quad \delta_1 > 0
\]

## (b) 2SLS Estimates

| Equation | Intercept         | \(Q\)                 | \(DI\)              | \(PS\)             | \(PF\)               | Correct sign? |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Demand** | \(-4.96\) (t = −6.4)  | \(-3.49\) (t = −3.8)  | 15.16 (t = 6.7)     |  4.00 (t = 4.4)    | −0.42 (t = −1.1)     | Yes           |
| **Supply** | −58.80 (t = −6.7)     |  2.94 (t = 9.1)       | —                   | —                  |  2.96 (t = 12.7)     | Yes           |

## (c) Price Elasticity of Demand at the Means

\[
\varepsilon = \frac{\gamma_1 \,\overline{P}}{\overline{Q}}
\;\approx\;
\frac{-3.489 \times 62.72}{18.46}
\;\approx\;-0.97
\]

## (d) Graph-ready Equations  
*(Holding \(DI=3.5,\; PF=23,\; PS=22\))*

- **Demand:**  
  \[
  P = 126.53 \;-\; 3.489\,Q
  \]
- **Supply:**  
  \[
  P = \;9.25 \;+\; 2.937\,Q
  \]
- **Equilibrium:**  
  \[
  Q^* = 18.25,\quad P^* = 62.85
  \]

---

## (e) Reduced-form Check

Using the reduced-form equations from Table 11.2 (with the same exogenous values):

\[
\hat Q = 18.26,\quad \hat P = 62.82
\]

These closely match the structural equilibrium (\(\Delta < 0.03\)).

## (f) OLS vs 2SLS

- **OLS demand slope** = +2.05 (wrong sign), reflecting simultaneity bias.  
- **2SLS demand slope** = −3.49 (correct negative slope).  
- Supply estimates under OLS and 2SLS are very similar.  
- **Conclusion:** 2SLS corrects the demand slope sign and yields consistent estimates.
