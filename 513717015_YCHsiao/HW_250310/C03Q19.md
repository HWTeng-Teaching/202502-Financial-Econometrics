# **Analysis of Occupancy Rates Over Time**

## **1. Visualization of Motel and Competitor Occupancy Rates**
The following plot shows the **occupancy rates** of a **motel** (in blue) and its **competitor** (in red) over time.

### **2. Observations**
- **General Trend**: The **motel's occupancy rate (blue line)** and the **competitor's occupancy rate (red line)** tend to move **together over time**, indicating a potential correlation.
- **Comparison**:
  - The **motel's occupancy rate** is generally **higher** than the competitor's occupancy rate in the early periods.
  - **After time period ~10**, the occupancy rates become **more volatile**, with fluctuations in both.
  - Around **time period 20**, both the motel and the competitor experience a significant **drop** in occupancy, possibly due to external factors such as **renovations** or **seasonal changes**.
- **Final Trends**: By the **end of the observation period**, the occupancy rates of both the motel and its competitor begin to **recover**.


## **3. Regression Model: Relationship Between Motel and Competitor Occupancy Rates**
To quantify this relationship, we estimate the following regression model:

$$MOTEL_{PCT} = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \cdot COMP_{PCT} + e$$

Where:
- $MOTEL$ _ $PCT$ = Motel occupancy rate
- $COMP$ _ $PCT$ = Competitor occupancy rate
- $\beta_1$ = Intercept (baseline motel occupancy when $COMP\_PCT = 0$)
- $\beta_2$ = Effect of competitor occupancy on motel occupancy
- $e$ = Error term (captures unexplained factors)

Using R:

```r
# Perform linear regression
model <- lm(motel_pct ~ comp_pct, data = motel_data)

# Display regression summary
summary(model)
```


**Summary Statistics**

| Term | Estimate | Std. Error | t Value | Pr(>t) |
|------|----------|------------|---------|----|
| Intercept      | 21.4000   | 12.9069    | 1.658   | 0.1109     |
| Slope          | 0.8646    | 0.2027     | 4.265   | 0.0003     |


**Residual Analysis:**
- **Min Residual**: -23.876
- **1st Quartile**: -4.909
- **Median**: -1.193
- **3rd Quartile**: 5.312
- **Max Residual**: 26.818


## **4. Model Fit and Significance**

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| **Multiple $R^2$** | 0.4417 |
| **Adjusted $R^2$** | 0.4174 |
| **Residual Standard Error** | 11.02 (on 23 degrees of freedom) |
| **F-statistic** | 18.19 (on 1 and 23 DF) |
| **p-value** | 0.0002906 |


## **5. Interpretation**

### **ðŸ”¹ Effect of Competitor Occupancy on Motel Occupancy**

- The **slope coefficient** $(\beta_2 = 0.8646)$ suggests that **for every 1% increase in COMP_PCT, the motel's occupancy rate increases by approximately 0.86%**.

- Since **$p = 0.0003$**, this effect is **highly statistically significant (p < 0.001)**.

### **ðŸ”¹ Model Fit**

- The **$R^2 = 0.4417$** indicates that **44.17% of the variance in MOTEL_PCT is explained by COMP_PCT**.

- This suggests a **moderate relationship**, meaning other factors might also be influencing motel occupancy.

### **ðŸ”¹ Confidence in the Estimates**

- The **standard error for $\beta_2$** is **0.2027**, and its 95% confidence interval can be computed as:

  ```r
  confint(model, level = 0.95)

  ```

Competitor occupancy has a significant positive effect on motel occupancy ($p < 0.001$).

The model explains 44.17% of the variance in motel occupancy, indicating a moderate relationship.

Additional factors should be considered for a more comprehensive model.

# **90% Confidence Interval for Expected MOTEL_PCT at COMP_PCT = 70**

## **1. Problem Statement**
We aim to construct a **90% confidence interval** for the **expected motel occupancy rate (`MOTEL_PCT`)** given that the competitor's occupancy rate (`COMP_PCT`) is **70%**.

Using the estimated regression model:

$$MOTEL\_{PCT} = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \cdot COMP\_{PCT} + e$$

we predict the **expected occupancy rate** when `COMP_PCT = 70` and compute the **90% confidence interval**.


## **2. R Code Execution**

We used the following **R code** to obtain the 90% confidence interval:

```r
# Compute the 90% confidence interval for MOTEL_PCT at COMP_PCT = 70
pred <- predict(model, newdata = data.frame(comp_pct = 70), interval = "confidence", level = 0.90)

```

# **Hypothesis Test for Î²â‚‚: One-Tailed Test at Î± = 0.01**

## **1. Problem Statement**
We want to test the null hypothesis:

$$
H_0: \beta_2 \leq 0
$$

against the alternative hypothesis:

$$
H_A: \beta_2 > 0
$$

at the **Î± = 0.01 significance level**.

The regression model used is:

$$
MOTEL\_PCT = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \cdot COMP\_PCT + e
$$

where:
- **$MOTEL\_PCT$** = Motel occupancy rate.
- **$COMP\_PCT$** = Competitor occupancy rate.
- **$\beta_2$** represents the effect of **competitor occupancy on motel occupancy**.

---

## **2. Test Statistic**
The **t-statistic** is calculated as:

$$
t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_2}{se(\hat{\beta}_2)}
$$

Using R, we obtained:

```r
t-statistic: 4.26536
```

For Î± = 0.01, the critical value for a one-tailed t-test with n - 2 degrees of freedom is:

Critical value (t_0.01): 2.499867

-Rejection Region: Reject $H_0$ if $t > 2.499867$.
-Since $4.26536 > 2.499867$, we reject $H_0$.

**Interpretation**

-Since $H_0$ is rejected, we conclude that $\beta_2 > 0$ is statistically significant.

-This suggests that higher competitor occupancy rates are associated with higher motel occupancy rates.

-The relationship between COMP_PCT and MOTEL_PCT is statistically significant at the 1% level.

# **Hypothesis Test for $\beta_2$: Two-Tailed Test at $\alpha = 0.01$**

## **1. Problem Statement**
We want to test the null hypothesis:

$$
H_0: \beta_2 = 1
$$

against the alternative hypothesis:

$$
H_A: \beta_2 \neq 1
$$

at the **$\alpha = 0.01$** significance level.

The regression model used is:

$$
MOTEL\_PCT = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \cdot COMP\_PCT + e
$$

where:
- **$MOTEL\_PCT$** = Motel occupancy rate.
- **$COMP\_PCT$** = Competitor occupancy rate.
- **$\beta_2$** represents the effect of **competitor occupancy on motel occupancy**.

---

## **2. Test Statistic**
The **t-statistic** is calculated as:

$$
t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_2 - 1}{se(\hat{\beta}_2)}
$$

Using R, we obtained:

```r
t-statistic: -0.6677491
```

For $\alpha = 0.01$, the critical value for a two-tailed t-test with n - 2 degrees of freedom is:

Critical value (t_0.005): 2.807336

Rejection Region: Reject $H_0$ if $|t| > 2.807336$.

Since $|-0.6677491| < 2.807336$, we fail to reject $H_0$.

**Interpretation**

Since $H_0$ is NOT rejected, we conclude that $\beta_2$ is not significantly different from 1.

This suggests that the motelâ€™s occupancy rate moves in a 1-to-1 relationship with the competitorâ€™s occupancy rate.

There is no strong statistical evidence to suggest that $\beta_2$ differs from 1.

# **Residual Analysis for MOTEL_PCT Regression on COMP_PCT**

## **1. Key Property of Least Squares Residuals**
- By definition, **least squares residuals sum to zero**, meaning their average is **zero**.
- This is confirmed by the residual plot, where the residuals fluctuate around the horizontal axis.



## **2. Residual Pattern Over Time**
- **Periods 1-16**: Residuals **alternate between positive and negative values**, indicating that the model sometimes **underestimates and sometimes overestimates** the occupancy rates.
- **Periods 17-23**: **All residuals except one are negative**, meaning that the model **overestimated motel occupancy during this period**.
- **Implication**: The predicted occupancy rates were **higher than the actual observed values**.



## **3. Residual Plot**

## **4. Conclusion**
| Analysis | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **Least Squares Property** | Residuals sum to zero |
| **Residual Pattern (1-16)** | Alternating positive/negative residuals |
| **Residual Pattern (17-23)** | Predominantly negative residuals |
| **Implication** | Model **overestimated** occupancy during periods 17-23 |

**Final Thoughts**
- The residual pattern suggests that the model **does not fully capture certain influences on occupancy**.
- Further analysis should consider **seasonality, economic conditions, or competitor strategies** to improve predictions.
