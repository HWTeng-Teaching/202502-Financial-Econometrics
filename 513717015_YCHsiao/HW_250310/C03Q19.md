# **Analysis of Occupancy Rates Over Time**

## **1. Visualization of Motel and Competitor Occupancy Rates**
The following plot shows the **occupancy rates** of a **motel** (in blue) and its **competitor** (in red) over time.

### **2. Observations**
- **General Trend**: The **motel's occupancy rate (blue line)** and the **competitor's occupancy rate (red line)** tend to move **together over time**, indicating a potential correlation.
- **Comparison**:
  - The **motel's occupancy rate** is generally **higher** than the competitor's occupancy rate in the early periods.
  - **After time period ~10**, the occupancy rates become **more volatile**, with fluctuations in both.
  - Around **time period 20**, both the motel and the competitor experience a significant **drop** in occupancy, possibly due to external factors such as **renovations** or **seasonal changes**.
- **Final Trends**: By the **end of the observation period**, the occupancy rates of both the motel and its competitor begin to **recover**.

## **3. Regression Model: Relationship Between Motel and Competitor Occupancy Rates**
To quantify this relationship, we estimate the following regression model:

$$
MOTEL\_PCT = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \cdot COMP\_PCT + e
$$

Where:
- $MOTEL\_PCT$ = Motel occupancy rate
- $COMP\_PCT$ = Competitor occupancy rate
- $\beta_1$ = Intercept (baseline motel occupancy when $COMP\_PCT = 0$)
- $\beta_2$ = Effect of competitor occupancy on motel occupancy
- $e$ = Error term (captures unexplained factors)

Using R:

```r
# Perform linear regression
model <- lm(motel_pct ~ comp_pct, data = motel_data)

# Display regression summary
summary(model)
```


**Summary Statistics**


| Term           | Estimate  | Std. Error | t Value | Pr>|t|  |
|----------------|-----------|------------|---------|---------|
| Intercept      | 21.4000   | 12.9069    | 1.658   | 0.1109  |
| Slope          | 0.8646    | 0.2027     | 4.265   | 0.0003  |



**Residual Analysis:**
- **Min Residual**: -23.876
- **1st Quartile**: -4.909
- **Median**: -1.193
- **3rd Quartile**: 5.312
- **Max Residual**: 26.818

## **3. Model Fit and Significance**
| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| **Multiple $R^2$** | 0.4417 |
| **Adjusted $R^2$** | 0.4174 |
| **Residual Standard Error** | 11.02 (on 23 degrees of freedom) |
| **F-statistic** | 18.19 (on 1 and 23 DF) |
| **p-value** | 0.0002906 |

## **4. Interpretation**
### **ðŸ”¹ Effect of Competitor Occupancy on Motel Occupancy**
- The **slope coefficient** $(\beta_2 = 0.8646)$ suggests that **for every 1% increase in COMP_PCT, the motel's occupancy rate increases by approximately 0.86%**.
- Since **$p = 0.0003$**, this effect is **highly statistically significant (p < 0.001)**.

### **ðŸ”¹ Model Fit**
- The **$R^2 = 0.4417$** indicates that **44.17% of the variance in MOTEL_PCT is explained by COMP_PCT**.
- This suggests a **moderate relationship**, meaning other factors might also be influencing motel occupancy.

### **ðŸ”¹ Confidence in the Estimates**
- The **standard error for $\beta_2$** is **0.2027**, and its 95% confidence interval can be computed as:

  ```r
  confint(model, level = 0.95)

  ```

Competitor occupancy has a significant positive effect on motel occupancy ($p < 0.001$).

The model explains 44.17% of the variance in motel occupancy, indicating a moderate relationship.

Additional factors should be considered for a more comprehensive model.

# **90% Confidence Interval for Expected MOTEL_PCT at COMP_PCT = 70**

## **1. Problem Statement**
We aim to construct a **90% confidence interval** for the **expected motel occupancy rate (`MOTEL_PCT`)** given that the competitor's occupancy rate (`COMP_PCT`) is **70%**.

Using the estimated regression model:

$$MOTEL\_PCT = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \cdot COMP\_PCT + e$$

we predict the **expected occupancy rate** when `COMP_PCT = 70` and compute the **90% confidence interval**.

---

## **2. R Code Execution**
We used the following **R code** to obtain the 90% confidence interval:
```r
# Compute the 90% confidence interval for MOTEL_PCT at COMP_PCT = 70
pred <- predict(model, newdata = data.frame(comp_pct = 70), interval = "confidence", level = 0.90)

```
