# Linear Regression t-Test Solution

## Problem
In 1992, 64 countries participated in the Olympics and won at least one medal. Let:
- `MEDALS` represent the total number of medals won.
- `GDPB` represent GDP (in billions of 1995 dollars).

The regression model is given as:

$$MEDALS = \beta_1 + \beta_2 GDPB + e$$

The estimated equation is:

$$MEDALS = 7.61733 + 0.01309GDPB$$

Standard errors:
$$(se) = (2.38994, 0.00215)$$

---

## (a) Hypothesis Testing
We test whether GDP is unrelated to the number of medals won.

- **Null hypothesis ($H_0$)**: $\beta_2 = 0$ (No relationship between GDP and medals)
- **Alternative hypothesis ($H_A$)**: $\beta_2 > 0$ (Positive relationship between GDP and medals)

This is a **one-tailed test**.

---

## (b) Test Statistic Calculation
The test statistic is computed as:

$$t = \frac{b_2 - 0}{\text{se}(b_2)}$$

Substituting the values:

$$t = \frac{0.01309}{0.00215} = 6.09$$

If $H_0$ is true, the test statistic follows a **t-distribution** with degrees of freedom:

$$n - k = 64 - 2 = 62$$

---

## (c) Distribution Shift Under $H_A$
- If $H_0$ is true , the expected value of $b_2$ is **0**, and the test statistic follows a **centered t-distribution**.
- If $H_A$ is true , the estimate of $b_2$ increases, shifting the test statistic **to the right**.

---

## (d) Critical Value at 1% Significance Level
From the **t-table**, the critical value for a **one-tailed** test at the **1% significance level** with **62 degrees of freedom** is:

$$t_{0.01, 62} \approx 2.39$$

Decision rules:
- **Reject $H_0$ if $t > 2.39$**.
- **Fail to reject $H_0$ if $t \leq 2.39$**.

---

## (e) Conducting the t-Test
The computed t-statistic is:

$$t = 6.09$$

Since **$6.09 > 2.39$**, we **reject $H_0$**.

### **Conclusion**
1. **Statistical conclusion**: There is strong evidence of a positive relationship between GDP and the number of Olympic medals.
2. **Economic interpretation**: Countries with higher GDP tend to win more Olympic medals.
3. **Meaning of the 1% significance level**: There is a **1% probability** of rejecting $ H_0 $ when it is actually true (Type I error). This means we are **highly confident** in our conclusion.

## **Final Summary**
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| (a) | $H_0: \beta_2 = 0$, $H_A: \beta_2 > 0$ |
| (b) | Test statistic $t = 6.09$ , follows $t(62)$ under $H_0$ |
| (c) | If $H_A$ is true, the t-distribution shifts **right** |
| (d) | Reject $H_0$ if $t > 2.39$ |
| (e) | $t = 6.09 > 2.39$, **reject $H_0$**, GDP positively affects medal count |
