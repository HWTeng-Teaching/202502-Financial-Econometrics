# Simple Linear Regression Analysis

## Problem Statement
We have 2008 data on **INCOME**, which represents income per capita (in thousands of dollars), and **BACHELOR**, which represents the percentage of the population with a bachelor's degree or higher across 50 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia. The dataset contains **$N = 51$** observations.

The estimated regression equation is:

$$\widehat{INCOME}=(a)+1.029BACHELOR$$

with standard errors:

$$se=(2.672,c)$$

and t-statistics:

$$t=(4.31,10.75)$$

---

## (a) Estimated Intercept Calculation
From the provided t-statistic formula:

$$t=\frac{\hat{\beta}}{se(\hat{\beta})}$$

For the intercept term:

$$4.31=\frac{a}{2.672}$$

Solving for $a$:

$$a=4.31\times2.672=11.52$$

Thus, the estimated intercept is **$11.52$**.

---

## (b) Relationship Interpretation
- The coefficient of **BACHELOR** is **$1.029$**, which is **positive**.
- This means that as the percentage of people with a **bachelor's degree increases, income per capita increases**.
- Since this is a **linear** relationship, the increase happens at a **constant rate**.

---

## (c) Standard Error of the Slope Coefficient
From the formula for the t-statistic:

$$t=\frac{\hat{\beta}_2}{se(\hat{\beta}_2)}$$

We solve for $se(\hat{\beta}_2)$:

$$10.75=\frac{1.029}{se(\hat{\beta}_2)}$$

$$se(\hat{\beta}_2)=\frac{1.029}{10.75}=0.0958$$

Thus, the standard error of the slope coefficient is **$0.09572$**.

---

## (d) t-Statistic for Testing $H_0: a=10$

Using the formula:

$$t=\frac{\hat{a}-10}{se(\hat{a})}$$

$$t=\frac{11.52-10}{2.672}=\frac{1.52}{2.672}=0.569$$

Thus, the test statistic is **$0.569$**.

---

## (e) p-Value and Rejection Region

The **p-value** for testing $H_0: a=10$ in a **two-tailed test** is given as **$0.572$**.

- Since **$\alpha=0.05$**, the rejection region is for **t-values beyond the critical values** of a two-tailed test at **$df=49$**.
- The critical values from a t-table at **$\alpha=0.05$** are approximately **$\pm2.009$**.
- Since $t=0.569$ falls **within** the acceptance region, we **fail to reject** $H_0$.

---

## (f) 99% Confidence Interval for the Slope

Using the confidence interval formula:

$$\hat{\beta}\pm t_{\alpha/2}\times se(\hat{\beta})$$

For a **99% confidence level**, the **critical t-value** for **$df=49$** is approximately **$2.68$**.

$$1.029\pm(2.68\times0.0958)$$

$$1.029\pm0.2567$$

$$(0.772,1.286)$$


### Interpretation:

- We are **99% confident** that the true slope coefficient lies between **$0.772$ and $1.286$**.
- This means the effect of **BACHELOR** on **INCOME** is significantly positive.

---

## (g) Hypothesis Test for $H_0: \beta_2=1$

We test:
- **Null Hypothesis**: $H_0: \beta_2=1$
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_A: \beta_2\neq1$

The t-statistic:

$$t=\frac{1.029-1}{0.0958}=\frac{0.029}{0.0958}=0.303$$

At the **5% significance level**, the **critical t-value** for **$df=49$** is **$\pm2.009$**.

- Since **$0.303$ is within $(-2.009,2.009)$**, we **fail to reject** $H_0$.
- **Conclusion**: The slope coefficient is **not significantly different from 1**.
- **Economic Interpretation**: The impact of **BACHELOR on INCOME** is approximately **1-to-1**, meaning a **1% increase in bachelor's degree attainment leads to about a $1,000 increase in per capita income**.
