## (a) Fill in the blank spaces

i. $t$-statistic for $\beta_1$: **0.6594**

ii. Standard error for $\beta_2$: **0.4842**

iii. Estimate for $\beta_3$: **-1.4549**

iv. $R^2$: **0.0575**

v. $\hat{\sigma}$ (Standard error of regression): **6.217**

## (b) Interpretation of Coefficients

- **$\hat{\beta}_2 = 2.765$ (lnTOTEXP)**  
  This means that a 1% increase in total household expenditure is associated with approximately a **2.76 percentage point increase** in the share of the household budget allocated to alcohol.  
  Since the independent variable is in log form and the dependent variable is in level form, the interpretation is **semi-elastic**.

- **$\hat{\beta}_3 = -1.4549$ (NK)**  
  An additional child in the household reduces the alcohol budget share by approximately **1.45 percentage points**, holding other factors constant.  
  This is a **level-level** interpretation.

- **$\hat{\beta}_4 = -0.1503$ (AGE)**  
  Each additional year of age of the household head is associated with a **0.15 percentage point decrease** in the alcohol budget share, holding other variables constant.

## (c) 95% Confidence Interval for $\beta_4$

The 95% confidence interval for $\beta_4$ (the coefficient on AGE) is:

[-0.1964,\ -0.1042]

### Interpretation:
We are 95% confident that each additional year of age of the household head is associated with a **decrease** in the alcohol budget share by between **0.1042 and 0.1964 percentage points**, holding other variables constant.

## (d) Are the coefficients statistically significant at 5%?

To test significance at the 5% level, we compare the p-values to 0.05:

- **$\beta_1$ (intercept)**: Not statistically significant ($p = 0.5099 > 0.05$)
- **$\beta_2$ (lnTOTEXP)**: Statistically significant ($p < 0.0001$)
- **$\beta_3$ (NK)**: Statistically significant ($p = 0.0001$)
- **$\beta_4$ (AGE)**: Statistically significant ($p < 0.0001$)

### Conclusion:
With the exception of the intercept, all coefficient estimates are significantly different from zero at a 5% level because their p-values are all less than 0.05. 

## (e) Hypothesis Test: Is the effect of an extra child equal to a 2 percentage point decrease?

We test the following hypotheses:

- $H_0: \beta_3 = -2$
- $H_1: \beta_3 \neq -2$

### Step 1: Compute the test statistic

$$t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_3 - (-2)}{SE(\hat{\beta}_3)} = \frac{-1.4549 - (-2)}{0.3695} = 1.4752$$

### Step 2: Determine critical value

At a 5% significance level (two-tailed), the critical value is:

$$\pm 1.96$$

### Step 3: Compare $t$-value to critical value

Since $1.4752 < 1.96$, we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis.

### Conclusion:

There is **insufficient evidence** to conclude that the effect of an extra child differs from a 2 percentage point decrease in the alcohol budget share at the 5% level.
