## (a) Summary Statistics and Histogram Analysis

We computed summary statistics for **`FOOD` and `INCOME`**, as shown in the table below:

---

### **Summary Statistics for FOOD and INCOME**
| Variable  | Mean   | Median | Min   | Max   | Std Dev |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| **FOOD**  | 114.44 | 99.80  | 9.63   | 476.67 | 72.66   |
| **INCOME** | 72.14  | 65.29  | 10.00  | 200.00 | 41.65   |

---

### **Histogram Analysis**
- **Both FOOD and INCOME distributions appear right-skewed**, as the **mean is larger than the median**.
- If histograms exhibit **long tails (skewed distribution)**, a **log transformation** (`log(FOOD)`, `log(INCOME)`) may improve model fit and normality.
- **Further evaluation of normality** is conducted using the **Jarque–Bera test**.

---

### **Jarque–Bera Normality Test Results**
| Variable | $X^2$ Value | p-value |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **FOOD**  | 648.65     | $< 2.2e-16$ |
| **INCOME** | 148.21     | $< 2.2e-16$ |

### **Conclusion**
- Since **p-values are extremely small (far below 0.05)**, we reject the null hypothesis that `FOOD` and `INCOME` are normally distributed.
- This suggests that **log transformation may be beneficial** in later regression models (log-log or linear-log models).

---

## (b) Estimating the Linear Relationship

We estimated the following linear regression model:

$$
FOOD = 88.5665 + 0.3587 \cdot INCOME + e
$$

### **Regression Results**
| Variable     | Estimate  | Std. Error | t-value | p-value |
|-------------|-----------|------------|---------|----------|
| **Intercept ($\beta_1$)** | 88.5665  | 4.1082     | 21.559  | $< 2 \times 10^{-16}$ *** |
| **Income ($\beta_2$)**   | 0.3587   | 0.0493     | 7.272   | $6.36 \times 10^{-13}$ *** |

- **$R^2$ (R-squared) = 0.0423**  
- **Adjusted $R^2$ = 0.0415**  
- **Residual Standard Error = 71.13**  
- **F-statistic = 52.89, p-value $6.357 \times 10^{-13}$ (highly significant)**  

---

### **Interpretation of the Regression Coefficients**
1. **Intercept ($\beta_1 = 88.5665$)**  
   - When household income is **0**, the predicted food expenditure is **88.57**.
   - Since a household income of 0 is unrealistic, this value primarily serves as a baseline reference rather than a meaningful interpretation.

2. **Income Coefficient ($\beta_2 = 0.3587$)**  
   - **For every 1-unit increase in income, food expenditure is expected to increase by 0.3587 units**.
   - The coefficient's **t-value is 7.272, and the p-value is far below 0.05**, indicating that income has a **highly significant impact** on food expenditure.

3. **Model Fit ($R^2 = 0.0423$)**  
   - This $R^2$ value is quite low, meaning that **income explains only 4.23% of the variation in food expenditure**.
   - This suggests that income has a weak influence on food expenditure, and other factors (e.g., household size, regional differences) might be more relevant.

---

### **Scatter Plot of FOOD vs. INCOME**
We generated a scatter plot with the fitted regression line:

```r
library(ggplot2)


# Scatter plot of FOOD vs. INCOME with regression line
ggplot(df, aes(x = income, y = food)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +  # Scatter points
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue", se = TRUE) +  # Regression line
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of FOOD vs. INCOME",
       x = "Household Income",
       y = "Food Expenditure") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6d533c8-6ac6-4143-8d62-8a896b5ab95f)

To assess the precision of our estimated coefficients, we compute the 95% confidence interval:

[0.2619,0.4555]

## (c) Residual Analysis

To evaluate the assumptions of the linear regression model:

$$
FOOD = \beta_1 + \beta_2 INCOME + e
$$

we analyzed the residuals.

---

### **Residuals vs. Income Plot**
- The residual plot **does not show a clear pattern**, suggesting that the relationship between **income and food expenditure is roughly linear**.
- However, there is a **slight increase in residual variance for higher income levels**, which might indicate some **heteroscedasticity**.
- If heteroscedasticity is a concern, using **log-log or linear-log models** may help stabilize the variance.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75e048a0-9300-4af7-b386-b88f7b0585a7)

---

### **Histogram of Residuals**
- The histogram of residuals **does not appear perfectly normal**.
- The distribution is **skewed right**, with some large positive residuals.
- This suggests that **a transformation (e.g., log transformation) may be necessary** to better satisfy the normality assumption.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4edc230d-1501-4ad9-bff3-726350a1c3a5)

---

### **Jarque–Bera Normality Test**
The **Jarque–Bera test** was conducted to formally test for normality:

| Test | $X^2$ Value | p-value |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Residuals** | 624.19 | $< 2.2 \times 10^{-16}$ |

- Since **p-value < 0.05**, we reject the null hypothesis that residuals follow a normal distribution.
- This confirms that **residuals are not normally distributed**, further supporting the idea that **model transformation** may be necessary.

---

### **Conclusion**
- The residuals **do not follow a normal distribution**.
- There is **some evidence of heteroscedasticity** at higher income levels.
- Applying **log transformations (log-log or linear-log models)** may improve model fit and normality.

---

## (d) Elasticity Estimation and 95% Confidence Interval

We estimated the **point elasticity** of food expenditure with respect to income at three specific income levels:  
**\( INCOME = 19, 65, 160 \)**.

The elasticity is calculated as:

$$
E = \beta_2 \times \frac{INCOME}{\hat{FOOD}}
$$

where:
- **$\beta_2 = 0.3587$** (from the linear regression model)
- **$\hat{FOOD}$** is the predicted food expenditure at each income level.

---

### **Elasticity Estimates**
| Income | Predicted $FOOD$ | Elasticity |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **19**  | 95.38           | 0.0715     |
| **65**  | 111.88          | 0.2084     |
| **160** | 145.96          | 0.3932     |

**Interpretation:**
- The elasticity **increases as income increases**, indicating that food expenditure becomes **more responsive** to income at higher levels.
- For **low-income households ($INCOME = 19$)**, the elasticity is very low **(0.0715)**, meaning food expenditure does not significantly change with income.
- For **higher-income households ($INCOME = 160$)**, the elasticity is much higher **(0.3932)**, indicating a greater responsiveness of food spending to income.

---

### **95% Confidence Interval for Elasticity**
Using the confidence interval for **$\beta_2$**:  
**$\beta_2 \in (0.2619, 0.4555)$**, we obtain the following **elasticity range**:

| Income | Elasticity | Lower Bound (95% CI) | Upper Bound (95% CI) |
|--------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **19**  | 0.0715     | 0.0522               | 0.0907               |
| **65**  | 0.2084     | 0.1522               | 0.2646               |
| **160** | 0.3932     | 0.2871               | 0.4993               |

**Interpretation:**
- The confidence intervals suggest **greater uncertainty in elasticity at higher income levels**.
- The elasticity values are **significantly below 1**, indicating that food is a **necessity good** rather than a luxury.
- As income rises, **the income elasticity of food expenditure also rises**, but it remains **inelastic** ($E < 1$), meaning food expenditure grows **at a slower rate** than income.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **The estimated elasticities are dissimilar across income levels**, increasing with higher incomes.
- **Food remains an inelastic good**, as the estimated elasticity is **always below 1**.
- **Higher-income households** show greater responsiveness in food expenditure to income changes.
- The **log-log model (to be estimated in part e)** might provide a better interpretation of elasticity.

---

## (e) Estimating the Log-Log Model

We estimated the following **log-log model**:

$$
\ln(FOOD) = \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 \ln(INCOME) + e
$$

### **Regression Results**
| Variable     | Estimate  | Std. Error | t-value | p-value |
|-------------|-----------|------------|---------|----------|
| **Intercept ($\gamma_1$)** | 3.7789  | 0.1204     | 31.400  | $< 2 \times 10^{-16}$ *** |
| **log(INCOME) ($\gamma_2$)**   | 0.1863   | 0.0290     | 6.417   | $2.00 \times 10^{-10}$ *** |

- **$R^2$ (R-squared) = 0.0332**  
- **Adjusted $R^2$ = 0.0324**  
- **Residual Standard Error = 0.6418**  
- **F-statistic = 41.18, p-value $1.999 \times 10^{-10}$ (highly significant)**  

---

### **Interpretation of the Regression Coefficients**
1. **Intercept ($\gamma_1 = 3.7789$)**  
   - When **$INCOME = 1$**, the predicted food expenditure is **$e^{3.7789} \approx 43.63$**.
   - This represents the baseline food expenditure for a very low-income household.

2. **Income Coefficient ($\gamma_2 = 0.1863$)**  
   - **A 1% increase in household income leads to a 0.1863% increase in food expenditure.**
   - Since **$\gamma_2 < 1$**, food is a **necessity good**, meaning its consumption increases **less than proportionally** with income.

3. **Comparison with Linear Model ($R^2$ Analysis)**
   - The **log-log model has a lower $R^2$ ($0.0332$) compared to the linear model ($R^2 = 0.0423$).**
   - This suggests that, in this case, the **log-log model does not improve the explanatory power significantly**.

---

### **Scatter Plot of $\ln(FOOD)$ vs. $\ln(INCOME)$**
- The scatter plot shows a **clearer linear relationship** compared to the original scale.
- The regression line **better captures the trend** than in the linear model.
- However, the **spread of data points suggests other unobserved factors may influence food expenditure**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6390b56-f835-487f-b2cf-0e5cf2f54fb5)


---

### **Conclusion**
- **The log-log model provides an estimate of elasticity directly**, showing that **food remains inelastic** ($\gamma_2 < 1$).
- However, the **lower $R^2$ suggests it does not fit the data better than the linear model**.
- The **relationship between food and income is still weak**, suggesting the need to **explore additional explanatory variables**.


---

## (f) Elasticity Estimation for the Log-Log Model

The **log-log model directly estimates the income elasticity of food expenditure** since the coefficient $\gamma_2$ represents the elasticity:

$$
E = \gamma_2 = 0.1863
$$

---

### **Elasticity Estimate and Confidence Interval**
| Estimate  | 95% Confidence Interval (Lower) | 95% Confidence Interval (Upper) |
|-----------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **0.1863** | **0.1293** | **0.2433** |

- **Interpretation:** A **1% increase in household income leads to a 0.1863% increase in food expenditure**.
- Since **$E < 1$**, food remains an **inelastic good**, meaning its consumption increases **less than proportionally** with income.
- The **95% confidence interval (0.1293, 0.2433)** suggests that **the true elasticity value is unlikely to exceed 0.25**, reinforcing the idea that food is a **necessity**.

---

### **Comparison to the Linear Model**
| Model          | Elasticity Estimate | Interpretation |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Linear Model** | **Varies by income level (0.0715 to 0.3932)** | Elasticity increases with income. |
| **Log-Log Model** | **Constant at 0.1863** | Income elasticity is **the same across all income levels**. |

- The **linear model suggests increasing elasticity as income grows**, while the **log-log model assumes constant elasticity**.
- Given that **the log-log model's confidence interval does not include values near 1**, this confirms that **food expenditure does not increase proportionally with income**.

---

### **Conclusion**
- The **log-log model provides a direct measure of elasticity**, making it useful for understanding income responsiveness.
- However, the **linear model suggests a more flexible relationship where elasticity increases with income**.
- If the assumption of **constant elasticity is unrealistic**, the **linear model may be preferable**.

---

## (g) Residual Analysis for the Log-Log Model

To evaluate the validity of the **log-log model**:

$$
\ln(FOOD) = \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 \ln(INCOME) + e
$$

we analyzed the residuals.

---

### **Residuals vs. log(INCOME) Plot**
- The **residuals are randomly scattered** across the range of log(INCOME), suggesting **no strong pattern**.
- There is **no clear heteroscedasticity**, meaning variance appears relatively stable across income levels.
- This **supports the assumption of homoscedasticity**, making the log-log model a potentially valid specification.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27c56051-5c9d-4bd5-8dd1-028dbbff7d0d)

---

### **Histogram of Residuals**
- The histogram of residuals **appears roughly normal**, but with some **minor skewness**.
- The residuals are **more concentrated around zero** compared to the linear model.
- **There are fewer extreme outliers**, indicating that taking the log transformation **helps stabilize variance**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eeb11865-9892-4b49-91e5-a84bed2c6c3c)

---

### **Jarque–Bera Normality Test**
We conducted the **Jarque–Bera test** to formally assess normality:

| Test | $X^2$ Value | p-value |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Residuals (Log-Log Model)** | 25.85 | $2.436 \times 10^{-6}$ |

- Since **p-value < 0.05**, we **reject the null hypothesis**, meaning **residuals deviate from normality**.
- However, the deviation **is much smaller than in the linear model**, suggesting that **the log transformation improves normality** but does not fully correct it.

---

### **Conclusion**
- The **log-log model improves normality and stabilizes variance**, making it a better fit than the linear model.
- However, **residuals are still not perfectly normal**, which may suggest additional model refinements.
- **Other transformations or additional explanatory variables** may further improve model fit.

---

## (h) Estimating the Linear-Log Model

We estimated the following **linear-log model**:

$$
FOOD = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 \ln(INCOME) + e
$$

### **Regression Results**
| Variable     | Estimate  | Std. Error | t-value | p-value |
|-------------|-----------|------------|---------|----------|
| **Intercept ($\alpha_1$)** | 23.568  | 13.370    | 1.763  | 0.0782 .  |
| **log(INCOME) ($\alpha_2$)**   | 22.187   | 3.225     | 6.879   | $9.68 \times 10^{-12}$ *** |

- **$R^2$ (R-squared) = 0.0380**  
- **Adjusted $R^2$ = 0.0372**  
- **Residual Standard Error = 71.29**  
- **F-statistic = 47.32, p-value $9.681 \times 10^{-12}$ (highly significant)**  

---

### **Interpretation of the Regression Coefficients**
1. **Intercept ($\alpha_1 = 23.568$)**  
   - This represents the predicted food expenditure when **$\ln(INCOME) = 0$**, which corresponds to an income of **1 unit** (not meaningful in practical terms).

2. **Income Coefficient ($\alpha_2 = 22.187$)**  
   - **A 1% increase in income leads to an increase of** **$0.22187$ units in food expenditure**.
   - This suggests **food expenditure grows at a decreasing rate** as income increases, but **not proportionally**.

3. **Comparison with Other Models ($R^2$ Analysis)**
   - **Linear Model**: \( R^2 = 0.0423 \)
   - **Log-Log Model**: \( R^2 = 0.0332 \)
   - **Linear-Log Model**: \( R^2 = 0.0380 \)

   **Conclusion**:
   - The **linear model still explains slightly more variance in food expenditure** than the linear-log model.
   - However, the **log transformation improves interpretability**, showing that income increases **have a diminishing effect** on food expenditure.

---

### **Scatter Plot of FOOD vs. log(INCOME)**
- The scatter plot shows a **slightly clearer relationship** compared to the linear model.
- However, **data points remain widely spread**, suggesting that **income alone is not a strong predictor of food expenditure**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36eb1019-d08c-4698-9e99-da0d9511b89f)

---

### **Conclusion**
- The **linear-log model suggests diminishing marginal increases in food expenditure as income grows**.
- However, its **$R^2$ value is slightly lower than the linear model**, meaning the **fit is not necessarily better**.
- If the assumption of **constant elasticity is unrealistic**, the **linear-log model may provide a better theoretical explanation**.


---

## (i) Elasticity Estimation for the Linear-Log Model

In the **linear-log model**:

$$
FOOD = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 \ln(INCOME) + e
$$

the **income elasticity of food expenditure** is given by:

$$
\hat{E} = \frac{\alpha_2}{\hat{FOOD}}
$$

where:
- **$\alpha_2 = 22.187$** (from regression).
- **$\hat{FOOD} = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 \ln(INCOME)$** (predicted food expenditure).
- We compute **confidence intervals** using the lower and upper bounds of $\alpha_2$.

---

### **Elasticity Estimates**
| Income | $\hat{FOOD}$ (Predicted) | $\hat{E}$ (Elasticity) |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **19**  | **88.8963**     | **0.2496** |
| **65**  | **116.1851**    | **0.1910** |
| **160** | **136.1709**    | **0.1629** |

- **Interpretation**:
  - **At low-income levels (\$19)**, food expenditure is **somewhat elastic ($E = 0.2496$)**, meaning income has a moderate effect.
  - **At higher-income levels (\$160)**, food becomes more **income-inelastic ($E = 0.1629$)**, meaning food expenditure **grows slowly with income increases**.
  - **Elasticity declines as income increases**, suggesting **diminishing returns of income on food spending**.

---

### **95% Confidence Interval for Elasticity**
Using the confidence interval for **$\alpha_2$**:  
**$\alpha_2 \in (15.867, 28.507)$**, we obtain the following **elasticity range**:

| Income | Elasticity | Lower Bound (95% CI) | Upper Bound (95% CI) |
|--------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **19**  | 0.2496     | 0.1785               | 0.3207               |
| **65**  | 0.1910     | 0.1366               | 0.2454               |
| **160** | 0.1629     | 0.1165               | 0.2093               |

- The **confidence intervals confirm a declining elasticity pattern**.
- **The values overlap with those from the log-log model ($E = 0.1863$), but decrease with income.**
- This **differs from the linear model**, where elasticity **varied across income levels in a non-uniform way**.

---

### **Comparison to Other Models**
| Model          | Elasticity Estimate | Interpretation |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Linear Model** | **Varies by income (0.0715 to 0.3932)** | Elasticity increases with income. |
| **Log-Log Model** | **Constant at 0.1863** | Food expenditure grows proportionally to income changes. |
| **Linear-Log Model** | **Declining (0.2496 to 0.1629)** | Income elasticity decreases as income increases. |

---

### **Conclusion**
- The **linear-log model suggests that food is slightly more elastic at lower-income levels but becomes more inelastic as income rises**.
- **Compared to the log-log model**, the **linear-log model provides a more flexible elasticity estimate** that varies across income levels.
- **This aligns with economic theory**, where **low-income households allocate a higher proportion of additional income to food, while high-income households do not**.


---

## (j) Residual Analysis for the Linear-Log Model

After estimating the linear-log model:

$$
FOOD = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 \ln(INCOME) + e
$$

we analyze the residuals to check for **model validity**.

---

### **Residual Plot: Residuals vs. \( \ln(INCOME) \)**

📌 **Observations from the residual plot:**
- **Residuals are scattered randomly around zero**, which suggests the model does not have serious misspecification.
- However, **variance increases as income increases**, indicating **heteroskedasticity**.
- Some **large residuals** for higher income values suggest possible outliers.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8254ee6b-aaa3-4eba-a714-f5982ccede7b)

---

### **Histogram of Residuals**

📌 **Observations from the histogram:**
- The **distribution is right-skewed**, deviating from normality.
- There are **several extreme positive residuals**, suggesting that the model **occasionally underpredicts** food expenditures.
- The **bell shape is distorted**, indicating potential non-normality.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3af573e5-0478-42c8-8c97-f98944211b12)

---

### **Jarque–Bera Test for Normality**

To formally test whether residuals follow a normal distribution, we performed the **Jarque–Bera test**:

$$
H_0: \text{Residuals are normally distributed}
$$

$$
H_1: \text{Residuals deviate from normality}
$$

**Test results:**
- **$X^2 = 628.07$**, **df = 2**, **p-value < 2.2e-16**.

📌 **Interpretation:**
- The **p-value is extremely small**, **rejecting the null hypothesis**.
- This confirms that the **residuals are not normally distributed**.
- The **right skew and large residuals violate normality assumptions**.

---

### **Conclusion**
- The **residual plot suggests heteroskedasticity** (variance increases with income).
- The **histogram and Jarque–Bera test confirm non-normal residuals**.
- **Transforming the dependent variable (log transformation on FOOD) might improve normality**.
- Further investigation is needed to correct for heteroskedasticity.
