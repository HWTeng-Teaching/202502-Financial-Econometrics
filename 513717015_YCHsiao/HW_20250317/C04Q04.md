# (c) Marginal Effect Calculation using Model 1

Model 1 is linear; thus, the marginal effect is constant and does not change with experience.

- (i) At $EXPER=10$, the marginal effect is:
  $$\frac{d(RATING)}{d(EXPER)} = 0.990$$

- (ii) At $EXPER=20$, the marginal effect remains:
  $$\frac{d(RATING)}{d(EXPER)} = 0.990$$

---

# (d) Marginal Effect Calculation using Model 2

The marginal effect of Model 2 decreases as experience increases:

- (i) At $EXPER=10$, the marginal effect is:
  $$\frac{d(RATING)}{d(EXPER)} = \frac{15.312}{10} = 1.5312$$

- (ii) At $EXPER=20$, the marginal effect is:
  $$\frac{d(RATING)}{d(EXPER)} = \frac{15.312}{20} = 0.7656$$

# (e) Model Comparison and Calculation of $R^2$

The formula for calculating $R^2$ is:

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{SSE}}{\text{SST}}
$$

- $\text{SSE}$ (Sum of Squared Errors): the sum of squared residuals from the model.
- $\text{SST}$ (Total Sum of Squares): the total variance, calculated as the sum of squared differences between observed values and their mean.

Provided data results:

- Model 1 (all samples): $R^2 = 0.3793$
- Model 1 (samples with experience only): $R^2 = 0.4858$
- Model 2 (samples with experience only): $R^2 = 0.6414$

Model 2 has a significantly higher $R^2$, indicating it better explains data variation and more accurately describes the relationship between experience and performance.

# (f)

Model two is more plausible. Model 1 suggests that each year of experience is associated with the same increase in rating. 

Model 2 suggests diminishing returns to experience, with the marginal effect of experience on rating larger for less experienced workers 

and less for more experienced workers.
