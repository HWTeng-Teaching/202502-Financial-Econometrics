## (a) Evaluation and Selection of Preferred Model

Based on the regression results of the four models, we have:

| Model | Equation                                      | Adjusted $R^2$ | Residual Std. Error |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 1     | $YIELD_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 TIME + e_t$      | $0.5687$       | $0.2791$            |
| 2     | $YIELD_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \ln(TIME) + e_t$| $0.3242$       | $0.3494$            |
| 3     | $YIELD_t = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 TIME^2 + e_t$  | $0.6822$       | $0.2396$            |
| 4     | $\ln(YIELD_t) = \phi_0 + \phi_1 TIME + e_t$   | $0.4966$       | $0.2598$ (log-scale)|

### Model Comparison:

- **Model 1** and **Model 3** have higher adjusted $R^2$ values ($0.5687$ and $0.6822$ respectively) and smaller residual standard errors.
- **Model 3** has the highest adjusted $R^2$ ($0.6822$) and the lowest residual standard error ($0.2396$), indicating it provides the best fit among all models.
- **Model 2** (logarithmic model) clearly performs worse, having the lowest adjusted $R^2$ ($0.3242$) and largest residual standard error ($0.3494$).
- **Model 4** (log-linear model) performs moderately but not as well as Model 3.

Therefore, **Model 3 (quadratic model)** is recommended as the preferred model:

$$
YIELD_t = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 TIME^2 + e_t
$$

due to its superior explanatory power (highest adjusted $R^2$) and lowest residual variance.

## (b) Interpretation of the Coefficient of the Time-Related Variable

Based on **Model 3 (Quadratic Model)**, the estimated regression equation is:

$$
YIELD_t = 0.7737 + 0.0004986 \cdot TIME^2 + e_t
$$

The regression results are:

| Variable   | Estimate      | Std. Error | t-value  | p-value |
|------------|--------------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Intercept ($\gamma_0$)**  | $0.7737$  | $0.0522$  | $14.82$  | $<2e-16$ |
| **$TIME^2$ ($\gamma_1$)**   | $0.0004986$ | $0.0000494$ | $10.10$ | $3.01e-13$ |

---

### **Interpretation of the Coefficient of $TIME^2$**
- **$\gamma_1 = 0.0004986$** represents the effect of the squared time variable on wheat yield.
- Since the coefficient is **positive**, it suggests an **accelerating increase** in wheat yield over time.
- The **p-value ($3.01 \times 10^{-13}$)** is very small, indicating that $TIME^2$ is highly statistically significant.
- This means that as time progresses, wheat yield growth is not just increasing, but increasing at an **increasing rate** (convex relationship).

## (c) Identifying Unusual Observations

### **Leverage threshold = 0.0833**
| northampton | time | h (leverage) |
|------------|------|----------|
| 1.6040      | 45   | 0.0854   |
| 1.6980      | 46   | 0.0953   |
| 1.9691      | 47   | 0.1061   |
| 2.2318      | 48   | 0.1179   |

---

### **Studentized residual threshold = 2**
| northampton | time | h        | ehatstu  |
|------------|------|----------|----------|
| 0.3024     | 14   | 0.0359   | -2.5607  |
| 0.6539     | 28   | 0.0583   | -2.2832  |
| 2.3161     | 43   | 0.0683   | 2.8894   |

---

### **DFBETAS threshold = 0.2887**
| northampton | time | h        | dfbeta2  |
|------------|------|----------|----------|
| 0.3024     | 14   | 0.0359   | 0.3205   |
| 2.3161     | 43   | 0.0683   | 0.6522   |
| 2.0534     | 44   | 0.0764   | 0.3383   |
| 2.2318     | 48   | 0.1179   | 0.4608   |

---

### **DFFITS threshold = 0.5077**
| northampton | time | h        | dffits   |
|------------|------|----------|----------|
| 0.3024     | 14   | 0.0359   | -0.4944  |
| 2.3161     | 43   | 0.0683   | 0.7823   |
| 2.2318     | 48   | 0.1179   | 0.5078   |

---

### **Conclusion:**
- **Observations 14, 43, 44, and 48** have high **DFBETAS**, meaning they significantly influence the coefficient of $TIME^2$.
- **Observations 14, 43, and 48** exceed the **DFFITS threshold**, meaning they strongly impact model predictions.
- **Observations 45, 46, 47, and 48** have high **Leverage values**, suggesting they are influential data points in the regression.
- **Observations 14, 28, and 43** exceed the **Studentized residual threshold**, indicating potential outliers.

These observations may need further investigation to determine whether they should be removed or if a robust regression model should be used.

## (d) Constructing a 95% Prediction Interval for $YIELD$ in 1997

Using **Model 3 (Quadratic Model)**, we estimate **1997 wheat yield** using data from **1950-1996** and calculate the 95% prediction interval.

---

### **Regression Model (1950-1996)**
From the re-estimated model, we obtain:

$$
YIELD_t = 0.7889 + 0.0004657 \cdot TIME^2 + e_t
$$

| Variable   | Estimate   | Std. Error | t-value | p-value |
|------------|------------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Intercept ($\gamma_0$)**  | $0.7889$  | $0.0532$  | $14.825$  | $<2e-16$ |
| **$TIME^2$ ($\gamma_1$)**   | $0.0004657$ | $0.0000547$ | $8.508$ | $7.61 \times 10^{-11}$ |

- Adjusted $R^2 = 0.6134$  
- Residual standard error = 0.2389  

---

### **95% Prediction Interval for 1997**
Using the model for prediction:

| Year | Predicted $YIELD$ | Lower Bound | Upper Bound |
|------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **1997** | **1.8177**  | **1.3042**  | **2.3311** |

---

### **Comparing with the Actual 1997 Yield**
- **Actual 1997 Yield = 1.9691**  
- The actual 1997 yield **falls within the 95% prediction interval** **(1.3042, 2.3311)**.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **The prediction interval successfully captures the actual yield in 1997**.
- This suggests that **Model 3 is reasonably accurate in forecasting future wheat yield**, considering the historical data from 1950-1996.
