Characteristics of WAGE (Hourly Wage):

Most people earn between $10 and $20 per hour.

The distribution is right-skewed, meaning most people have lower wages, with just a few earning very high wages.

Because of a few very high earners, the average wage is usually higher than the median wage.

Characteristics of EDUC (Years of Education):

Most people have 12 years (high school) or 16 years (college) of education.

The data has clear peaks at these common levels: finishing high school (12 years) and finishing college (16 years).

There's also a smaller peak at higher education levels (18 years or more, for graduate degrees).

The linear regression model is

$\hat{y}= -10.4 + 2.3968 x $

Slope (EDUC): 2.3968

On average, hourly wages increase by approximately $2.40 for each additional year of education.

This coefficient is highly significant (p-value < 2e-16), indicating that years of education significantly affect wages.

Adjusted R-squared: 0.2067

This means about 20.67% of the variation in wages is explained by education alone. Other factors also influence wages.

F-statistic: 313.3 (p-value < 2.2e-16)

This strongly supports the statistical significance of the overall regression model, indicating a strong relationship between education level and wages.

I plotted the residuals against EDUC. There's a clear pattern:

When EDUC goes up, the residuals also get bigger.

This means the variance of the errors gets larger as education increases, which violates assumption SR3.

If all the assumptions SR1–SR5 are correct, the residuals shouldn't show any clear patterns like this.

```
# 建立線性回歸模型 (若尚未建立)
model <- lm(wage ~ educ, data = data)

# 計算並儲存殘差
data$residuals <- residuals(model)

# 查看前幾筆殘差
head(data$residuals)

  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Residuals vs. EDUC",
       x = "Years of Education (EDUC)",

After running the quadratic regression, we found a significant non-linear relationship between education and wage.

We should know that the quadratic regression form R result $WAGE = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 EDUC^2 + e = 4.9165 + 0.0891 EDUC^2$

At 12 years of education, each additional year increases wages by about 2.1392 dollars/hour.

At 16 years of education, the wage increase per year of education rises to about 2.8523 dollars/hour.

Compared to the linear regression (which predicts a constant 2.40 dollars/hour increase), 

the quadratic model suggests that the benefit of education varies depending on how many years you already have.


```
# 建立 EDUC 的平方項
data$educ2 <- data$educ^2

# 估計二次回歸模型
quad_model <- lm(wage ~ educ2, data = data)

# 顯示結果
summary(quad_model)

# 提取 α₂ 的估計值
alpha2 <- coef(quad_model)["educ2"]


# EDUC = 12年時的邊際效果
marginal_effect_12 <- 2 * alpha2 * 12

# EDUC = 16年時的邊際效果
marginal_effect_16 <- 2 * alpha2 * 16

marginal_effect_12
marginal_effect_16

```

The quadratic model appears to fit the data slightly better than the linear equation, especially at lower levels of education. 





```
library(ggplot2)

# 建立 EDUC 平方變數（若尚未建立）
data$educ2 <- data$educ^2

# 線性回歸模型（part b）
linear_model <- lm(wage ~ educ, data = data)
data$linear_fit <- predict(linear_model)

# 二次回歸模型（part e）
quad_model <- lm(wage ~ educ2, data = data)
data$quad_fit <- predict(quad_model)

# 繪圖
ggplot(data, aes(x = educ, y = wage)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, color = "gray") + # 原始資料點
  geom_line(aes(y = linear_fit), color = "blue", size = 1.2, linetype = "dashed") + # 線性擬合線
  geom_line(aes(y = quad_fit), color = "red", size = 1.2) + # 二次擬合線
  labs(title = "Linear vs Quadratic Fit of Wage on Education",
       x = "Years of Education",
       y = "Hourly Wage") +
  theme_minimal() +
