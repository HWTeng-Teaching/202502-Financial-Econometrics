## Part (a) - Urban Regression Hypothesis Test

We are asked to test the null hypothesis that the regression slope \( \beta_2 \) equals 1.80 against the alternative that it is greater than 1.80. The significance level is \( \alpha = 0.05 \).

### Hypothesis Setup:
- Null hypothesis: \( H_0: \beta_2 = 1.80 \)
- Alternative hypothesis: \( H_A: \beta_2 > 1.80 \)
- Significance level: \( \alpha = 0.05 \)

### Test Statistic:
We calculate the t-statistic as:
\[
t = \frac{\hat{\beta_2} - 1.80}{\text{se}(\hat{\beta_2})}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
t = \frac{2.46 - 1.80}{0.16} = \frac{0.66}{0.16} = 4.125
\]

### Critical Value:
For \( N - 2 = 984 \) degrees of freedom and \( \alpha = 0.05 \), the critical value from the t-distribution is \( t_{0.05, 984} = 1.645 \).

we **reject the null hypothesis**. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the slope is greater than 1.80.

## Part (b) - Rural Regression 95% Confidence Interval

We are asked to compute the 95% confidence interval for expected WAGE when \( EDUC = 16 \) using the rural regression.

### Step 1: Compute the Expected WAGE:
\[
\hat{WAGE} = -4.88 + 1.80 \cdot 16 = -4.88 + 28.80 = 23.92
\]

### Step 2: Standard Error of Estimate:
The given standard error for the rural regression estimate is 0.833.

### Step 3: Find the Critical Value:
For a 95% confidence interval with \( N - 2 = 212 \) degrees of freedom, the critical value \( t_{0.025, 212} \) is approximately 1.972.

### Step 4: Calculate the Confidence Interval:
\[
CI = 23.92 \pm 1.972 \cdot 0.833
\]
\[
CI = 23.92 \pm 1.645
\]
Thus, the 95% confidence interval is:
\[
CI = [22.275, 25.565]
\]

## Part (c) - Urban Regression 95% Confidence Interval

We are now asked to compute the 95% confidence interval for expected WAGE when \( EDUC = 16 \) using the urban regression.

### Step 1: Compute the Expected WAGE:
\[
\hat{WAGE} = -10.76 + 2.46 \cdot 16 = -10.76 + 39.36 = 28.60
\]

### Step 2: Standard Error of Estimate:
The formula for the standard error is:
\[
SE = \sqrt{\text{se}(\hat{\beta_1})^2 + \text{se}(\hat{\beta_2})^2 \cdot x^2 + 2 \cdot \text{cov}(\hat{\beta_1}, \hat{\beta_2}) \cdot x}
\]
Where:
- \( \text{se}(\hat{\beta_1}) = 2.27 \)
- \( \text{se}(\hat{\beta_2}) = 0.16 \)
- \( x = 16 \)
- Covariance: \( \text{cov}(\hat{\beta_1}, \hat{\beta_2}) = -0.345 \)

Calculating the standard error:
\[
SE = \sqrt{2.27^2 + 0.16^2 \cdot 16^2 + 2 \cdot (-0.345) \cdot 16}
\]
\[
SE = \sqrt{5.1529 + 0.4096 \cdot 256 + (-1.104)} = \sqrt{5.1529 + 104.4416 - 1.104} = \sqrt{108.4905}
\]
\[
SE \approx 10.42
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Confidence Interval:
\[
CI = 28.60 \pm 1.972 \cdot 10.42
\]
\[
CI = 28.60 \pm 20.56
\]
Thus, the 95% confidence interval is:
\[
CI = [8.04, 49.16]
\]

The urban regression interval is wider than the rural interval from part (b). This is plausible because the standard error is higher for the urban regression, which reflects more uncertainty in the estimate.

## Part (d) - Rural Regression Hypothesis Test on Intercept

 \( \beta_1 \) = 4 against the alternative that it is less than 4, using a 1% significance level.

### Hypothesis Setup:
- Null hypothesis: \( H_0: \beta_1 = 4 \)
- Alternative hypothesis: \( H_A: \beta_1 < 4 \)
- Significance level: \( \alpha = 0.01 \)

### Test Statistic:
We calculate the t-statistic for the intercept:
\[
t = \frac{\hat{\beta_1} - 4}{\text{se}(\hat{\beta_1})}
\]
Where:
- \( \hat{\beta_1} = -4.88 \)
- \( \beta_1 = 4 \)
- \( \text{se}(\hat{\beta_1}) = 3.29 \)

\[
t = \frac{-4.88 - 4}{3.29} = \frac{-8.88}{3.29} \approx -2.70
\]

### Critical Value:
For \( N - 2 = 212 \) degrees of freedom and \( \alpha = 0.01 \), the critical value \( t_{0.01, 212} \) is approximately -2.326.

Since \( t = -2.70 \) is less than \( -2.326 \), we **reject the null hypothesis**. There is sufficient evidence at the 1% significance level to conclude that the intercept \( \beta_1 \) is less than 4.
