### Analysis of Income and Bachelor’s Degree Regression

#### (a) Calculate the Estimated Intercept:
The estimated regression equation is:
\[ \hat{INCOME} = a + 1.029 \times BACHELOR \]

From the given table, the t-statistic for the intercept is 4.31, and the standard error for the intercept is 2.672. The t-statistic is computed as:
\[ t = \frac{a}{SE(a)} \]

Rearranging for \( a \):
\[ a = t \times SE(a) = 4.31 \times 2.672 = 11.52 \]

So, the estimated intercept is **11.52**.

#### (b) Sketching the Estimated Relationship:
The regression equation shows that as the percentage of people with a bachelor’s degree increases, income per capita also increases. This indicates a **positive** and **linear** relationship, meaning income increases at a constant rate as education increases.

#### (c) Calculate the Standard Error of the Slope Coefficient:
The t-statistic for the slope is given as 10.75. Since the t-statistic formula is:
\[ t = \frac{b_1}{SE(b_1)} \]

Rearranging for \( SE(b_1) \):
\[ SE(b_1) = \frac{b_1}{t} = \frac{1.029}{10.75} = 0.0958 \]

#### (d) Compute the t-statistic for the Null Hypothesis that the Intercept Equals 10:
We test:
\[ H_0: a = 10 \]
\[ H_1: a \neq 10 \]

Using the t-statistic formula:
\[ t = \frac{a - 10}{SE(a)} = \frac{11.52 - 10}{2.672} = \frac{1.52}{2.672} = 0.569 \]

#### (e) Sketching the p-value and Rejection Region:
The given p-value is **0.572** for the two-tailed test. Since \( \alpha = 0.05 \), we reject \( H_0 \) if the p-value is less than 0.05. Here, the p-value is much larger, so we **fail to reject** \( H_0 \), meaning we do not have strong evidence that the intercept is different from 10.

#### (f) Construct a 99% Confidence Interval for the Slope:
The confidence interval formula is:
\[ b_1 \pm t_{critical} \times SE(b_1) \]

For 99% confidence and 49 degrees of freedom (N-2 = 51-2), the critical t-value is approximately **2.68**. Thus, the interval is:
\[ 1.029 \pm (2.68 \times 0.0958) \]
\[ 1.029 \pm 0.2565 \]
\[ (0.773, 1.286) \]

**Interpretation:** We are 99% confident that the true slope lies within (0.773, 1.286), meaning there is strong evidence of a positive relationship between education and income.

#### (g) Testing the Null Hypothesis that the Slope is 1:
We test:
\[ H_0: b_1 = 1 \]
\[ H_1: b_1 \neq 1 \]

The t-statistic is computed as:
\[ t = \frac{b_1 - 1}{SE(b_1)} = \frac{1.029 - 1}{0.0958} = \frac{0.029}{0.0958} = 0.303 \]

For a 5% significance level, the critical value for a two-tailed test is **±2.01**. Since \( 0.303 \) is much smaller than 2.01, we **fail to reject** \( H_0 \).
