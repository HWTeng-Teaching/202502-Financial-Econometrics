### Hypothesis Testing for Olympic Medals and GDP Regression

#### (a) State the null and alternative hypotheses:
We are testing whether there is a relationship between GDP and the number of medals won.

- Null hypothesis (H₀): β₂ = 0 (There is no relationship between GDP and the number of medals won.)
- Alternative hypothesis (H₁): β₂ > 0 (There is a positive relationship between GDP and the number of medals won.)

#### (b) Test Statistic and Distribution:
The test statistic is given by:

\[ t = \frac{b_2}{SE(b_2)} \]

From the regression output:

- \( b_2 = 0.01309 \)
- \( SE(b_2) = 0.00215 \)

So the test statistic is:

\[ t = \frac{0.01309}{0.00215} = 6.09 \]

Under the null hypothesis, the test statistic follows a t-distribution with \( n - k \) degrees of freedom, where \( n = 64 \) and \( k = 2 \) (since we estimate two parameters, \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \)). So the degrees of freedom are \( 64 - 2 = 62 \).

#### (c) Distribution Shift:
- If \( H_0 \) is true, the expected value of \( b_2 \) is 0, so the t-distribution is centered at 0.
- If \( H_1 \) is true, the expected value of \( b_2 \) is greater than 0, so the distribution shifts to the right.

#### (d) Critical Values for a 1% Significance Level:
For a one-tailed test at the 1% significance level with 62 degrees of freedom, the critical value from the t-table is approximately:

\[ t_{0.01, 62} = 2.39 \]

- If \( t > 2.39 \), we reject \( H_0 \).
- If \( t \leq 2.39 \), we fail to reject \( H_0 \).

#### (e) Conducting the t-test:
Since our computed test statistic is:

\[ t = 6.09 \]

which is much greater than the critical value of 2.39, we reject the null hypothesis at the 1% level.

**Economic Conclusion:** There is strong statistical evidence to suggest that a country’s GDP is positively related to the number of Olympic medals won. Economically, this implies that wealthier countries tend to win more medals.

**Interpretation of 1% Significance Level:** The 1% significance level means that there is only a 1% probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. In other words, there is a very low chance that our conclusion is due to random chance.
