(a) 

Model 1 is given as:

$\widehat{RATING} = 64.289 + 0.990 \cdot EXPER$

This is a linear function, so the fitted values increase linearly as experience increases.

Sample fitted values:

When EXPER = 0: $\widehat{RATING} = 64.289$

When EXPER = 10: $\widehat{RATING} = 64.289 + 0.990 \cdot 10 = 74.189$

When EXPER = 20: $\widehat{RATING} = 84.089$

When EXPER = 30: $\widehat{RATING} = 93.989$

This would produce a straight line with a constant slope of 0.990.

\
(b) 

Model 2 is specified as:

$\widehat{RATING} = 39.464 + 15.312 \cdot \ln(EXPER)$

This is a log-linear model, implying diminishing marginal returns.

Sample fitted values:

EXPER = 1: $\ln(1) = 0 \Rightarrow \widehat{RATING} = 39.464$

EXPER = 10: $\widehat{RATING} = 39.464 + 15.312 \cdot \ln(10) \approx 74.788$

EXPER = 30: $\widehat{RATING} \approx 39.464 + 15.312 \cdot \ln(30) \approx 91.536$

This function increases at a decreasing rate, producing a concave shape.

Why are the 4 artists with no experience excluded?

Because $\ln(0)$ is undefined ($\ln(0) = -\infty$), observations with $EXPER = 0$ cannot be used in Model 2.

\
(c) 

Since Model 1 is linear:

$\frac{\partial \widehat{RATING}}{\partial EXPER} = 0.990$

Thus, the marginal effect is constant regardless of experience level:

    (i) At EXPER = 10: marginal effect = 0.990

    (ii) At EXPER = 20: marginal effect = 0.990
    
\
(d) 

Model 2:

$\widehat{RATING} = 39.464 + 15.312 \cdot \ln(EXPER)$

The marginal effect is the derivative with respect to EXPER:

$\frac{\partial \widehat{RATING}}{\partial EXPER} = \frac{15.312}{EXPER}$

So:

(i) At EXPER = 10: $\frac{15.312}{10} = 1.531$

(ii) At EXPER = 20: $\frac{15.312}{20} = 0.766$

This confirms diminishing returns to experience.

\
(e) 

Compare the $R^2$ values:

Model 1: $R^2 = 0.3793$

Model 2: $R^2 = 0.6414$

Model 2 clearly fits the data better. Even when Model 1 is re-estimated using only those with $EXPER > 0$, the adjusted $R^2$ is $0.4858$, still below Model 2â€™s $0.6414$.

Thus, Model 2 has better explanatory power.

\
(f) 

Model 2 is more plausible due to:

Diminishing returns to experience: Modeled by the log function

Realistic behavior: Early experience yields greater performance gains, which level off with time

Better statistical fit: Model 2 has a higher $R^2$

Avoids overestimation: Model 1 implies linear growth indefinitely, which is unrealistic

Therefore, Model 2 is both economically and statistically more reasonable.
