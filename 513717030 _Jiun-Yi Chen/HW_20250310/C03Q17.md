# Regression Analysis on Wage and Education

## Problem Statement
We consider the regression model:

$$WAGE=\beta_1+\beta_2EDUC+e$$

where **WAGE** is the hourly wage rate in US 2013 dollars, and **EDUC** represents years of schooling. The model is estimated separately for individuals in **urban** and **rural** areas.


$$\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Urban:} \quad & \widehat{WAGE} = -10.76 + 2.46\,EDUC \quad (N = 986),\\
\text{Rural:} \quad & \widehat{WAGE} = \,-4.88 + 1.80\,EDUC \quad (N = 214).
\end{aligned}
\]$$


We assume classical linear model conditions (e.g., errors are i.i.d. normal with constant variance).

# (a) Urban Regression: Test $\beta_2$ > 1.80 at $\alpha$ = 0.05
