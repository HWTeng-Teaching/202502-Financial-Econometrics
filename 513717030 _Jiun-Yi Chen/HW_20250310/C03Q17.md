# Regression Analysis on Wage and Education

## Problem Statement
We consider the regression model:

$$WAGE=\beta_1+\beta_2EDUC+e$$

where **WAGE** is the hourly wage rate in US 2013 dollars, and **EDUC** represents years of schooling. The model is estimated separately for individuals in **urban** and **rural** areas.


**Urban Regression:**

$$\widehat{WAGE}=-10.76+2.46EDUC, \quad N=986$$

$$(se)=(2.27,0.16)$$

**Rural Regression:**

$$\widehat{WAGE}=-4.88+1.80EDUC, \quad N=214$$

$$(se)=(3.29,0.24)$$



We assume classical linear model conditions (e.g., errors are i.i.d. normal with constant variance).
## (a) Hypothesis Test for Urban Regression: $\beta_2=1.80$
## Hypothesis Test for Regression Slope in Urban Model

### Step 1: State the Hypotheses
$H_0: \beta_2 = 1.80$

$H_a: \beta_2 > 1.80$

### Step 2: Compute the Test Statistic
The test statistic for a hypothesis test on a regression coefficient is given by:

$$
t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_2 - \beta_2}{\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_2)}
$$

From the given urban regression results:
- $\hat{\beta}_2 = 2.46$
- Standard error ($\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_2)$) = 0.16
- $\beta_2$ under the null hypothesis = 1.80

$$
t = \frac{2.46 - 1.80}{0.16} = \frac{0.66}{0.16} = 4.125
$$

### Step 3: Determine the Critical Value
Since this is a **one-tailed test** at $\alpha = 0.05$, we find the critical value $t_{0.05, 984}$ from the t-distribution with $df = N - 2 = 986 - 2 = 984$. 

Using standard t-tables:

$$
t_{0.05, 984} \approx 1.645
$$

### Step 4: Compare and Make a Decision
Since our computed test statistic $ t = 4.125 $ is **greater** than the critical value $1.645$, we **reject** the null hypothesis.

### Step 5: Conclusion
At the $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level, we have enough evidence to conclude that the true slope $\beta_2$ in the urban regression is **greater than 1.80**.

### Step 6: Graphical Representation of Critical Region

- The **blue curve** represents the t-distribution.
- The **red shaded area** represents the **rejection region** at $\alpha = 0.05$.
- The **dashed green line** marks the computed t-statistic $t = 4.125$, which falls in the rejection region.

Since the test statistic exceeds the critical value, we **reject the null hypothesis** and conclude that the regression slope in the urban model is **significantly greater than 1.80** at the 5% significance level.

## (b) 95% Confidence Interval for Rural Regression at $EDUC=16$

We compute the 95% confidence interval for expected $WAGE$ when $EDUC = 16$.

The regression equation for the rural area is:

$$
\widehat{WAGE} = -4.88 + 1.80 \times EDUC
$$

Substituting $EDUC = 16$:

$$
\widehat{WAGE} = -4.88 + 1.80 \times 16 = -4.88 + 28.80 = 23.92
$$

The standard error for the prediction is given as $0.833$. The critical $t$-value at 95% confidence level (for large $N$) is approximately:

$$
t_{0.025, 212} \approx 1.97
$$

Thus, the confidence interval is:

$$
23.92 \pm 1.97 \times 0.833
$$

$$
23.92 \pm 1.64
$$

Final 95% confidence interval:

$$
(22.28, 25.56)
$$

Conclusion:
In repeated sampling, about 95% intervals constructed this way will contain the true value of the parameter $\beta_2$.

#### Note: **Standard Error Calculation**
The standard error of the estimated mean response at $EDUC = 16$ is calculated using:

$$
SE(\hat{WAGE}) = \sqrt{SE(\hat{\beta}_1)^2 + 16^2 SE(\hat{\beta}_2)^2 + 2(16)Cov(\hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2)}
$$

Given:
- $SE(\hat{\beta}_1) = 3.29$
- $SE(\hat{\beta}_2) = 0.24$
- $Cov(\hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2) = -0.761$

$$
SE(\hat{WAGE}) = \sqrt{(3.29)^2 + 16^2 (0.24)^2 + 2(16)(-0.761)}
$$

$$
= \sqrt{10.8241 + 14.7456 - 24.352}
$$

$$
= \sqrt{1.2177} \approx 1.10349
$$

## (c) 95% Confidence Interval for Urban Regression at $EDUC=16$

For the urban regression:

$$
\widehat{WAGE} = -10.76 + 2.46 \times EDUC
$$

Substituting $EDUC = 16$:

$$
\widehat{WAGE} = -10.76 + 2.46 \times 16 = -10.76 + 39.36 = 28.60
$$

Using the estimated covariance $Cov(\hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2) = -0.345$, we compute the standard error:
**Urban Regression:**

$$\widehat{WAGE}=-10.76+2.46EDUC, \quad N=986$$

$$(se)=(2.27,0.16)$$

$$
SE(\hat{WAGE}) = \sqrt{(2.27)^2 + 16^2 (0.16)^2 + 2(16)(-0.345)}
$$

$$
= \sqrt{0.6665} = 0.816
$$

confidence interval = [ 28.6-1.96(0.816)=27.00 , 28.6+1.96(0.816)=30.20 ] 

**Comparison of Interval Widths**: The confidence interval for urban regression is expected to be **narrower** than the rural one because:
1. Urban regression has a **larger sample size**, leading to lower standard errors.
2. The variance of coefficients is generally smaller in larger samples.

Thus, it is **plausible** that the urban interval is narrower.

### **(d) Hypothesis Test for the Rural Intercept Parameter $\beta_1$**
We test:

- $H_0: \beta_1 = 4$
- $H_a: \beta_1 < 4$ (one-tailed test)
- Given $\hat{\beta}_1 = -4.88$, $SE(\hat{\beta}_1) = 3.29$
- Significance level: $\alpha = 0.01$

Test statistic:

$$
t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1 - \beta_1}{SE(\hat{\beta}_1)}
$$

$$
t = \frac{-4.88 - 4}{3.29} = \frac{-8.88}{3.29} = -2.70
$$

Using the $t$-distribution with $df = 212$, the critical value for $\alpha = 0.01$ is:

$$
t_{0.01, 212} \approx -2.33
$$

Since **$t = -2.70 < -2.33$**, we **reject** $H_0$.

#### **Conclusion**
At the **1% significance level**, there is **sufficient evidence** to conclude that the intercept $\beta_1$ is **less than 4**.
