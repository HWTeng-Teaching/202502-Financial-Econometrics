### Part (a)

We are testing whether there is a relationship between the number of medals won and GDP.

1. **Null Hypothesis $H_0$**: There is no relationship between the number of medals won and GDP.  
   $H_0: \beta_2 = 0$
2. **Alternative Hypothesis $H_A$**: There is a positive relationship between the number of medals won and GDP.  
   $H_A: \beta_2 > 0$

This is a one-sided (right-tailed) test because we are testing for a positive relationship.

### Part (b)

The test statistic for testing $H_0: \beta_2 = 0$ is given by the t-statistic:

$t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_2 - 0}{\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_2)}$

From the regression output:

- $\hat{\beta}_2 = 0.01309$
- $\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_2) = 0.00215$

$t = \frac{0.01309 - 0}{0.00215} = \frac{0.01309}{0.00215} \approx 6.09$

#### **Distribution of the Test Statistic**
Under the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta_2 = 0$, the test statistic follows a $t$-distribution with n - k = 64 - 2 = 62 degrees of freedom.

$t \sim t_{62}$

This test statistic is compared against the critical value from the $t_{62}$ distribution for a one-tailed test at a chosen significance level (e.g., $\alpha = 0.05$).

### Part (c)
If the alternative hypothesis is true, the expected value of $b_2$ is greater than zero. This means that the estimated coefficient $\hat{\beta}_2$ will tend to be larger than zero on average. Consequently, the test statistic:

$t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_2}{\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_2)}$

will also be larger than expected under the null hypothesis. Since the test statistic follows a $t$-distribution under $H_0$, but has a positive mean shift under $H_A$, the distribution of $t$ will shift to the right.

### Part (d)
For a one-tailed test at the $1\%$ level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic is greater than the critical value from the $t$-distribution with $62$ degrees of freedom:

$t_{\alpha=0.01, df=62}$

Using statistical tables, the critical value for $t_{62}$ at $\alpha = 0.01$ is approximately:

$t_{0.01, 62} \approx 2.39$

Thus, we reject the null hypothesis if: $t > 2.39$

Conversely, we fail to reject the null hypothesis if:

$t \leq 2.39$

### Part (e)
We calculated the test statistic in part (b):  t = 6.09

Since $t = 6.09 > 2.39$, we reject the null hypothesis at the 1% significance level.

#### **Economic Conclusion:**
This result provides strong statistical evidence that GDP has a significant positive effect on the number of Olympic medals won. This suggests that wealthier countries tend to win more medals.

#### **Interpretation of the 1% Significance Level:**
A 1% significance level means that there is only a 1% probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error). In other words, the probability of mistakenly concluding that GDP influences the number of medals when in fact there is no relationship is just 1%.
