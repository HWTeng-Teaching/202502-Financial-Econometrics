# **Analysis of Occupancy Rates Over Time**

## **1. Visualization of Motel and Competitor Occupancy Rates**
The following plot shows the **occupancy rates** of a **motel** (in green) and its **competitor** (in brown) over time.

### **2. Observations**
- **General Trend**: The **motel's occupancy rate (green)** and the **competitor's occupancy rate (brown)** tend to move **together over time**, indicating a potential correlation.
- **Comparison**:
  - The **motel's occupancy rate** is generally **higher** than the competitor's occupancy rate in the early periods.
  - **After time period ~10**, the occupancy rates become **more volatile**, with fluctuations in both.
  - Around **time period 20**, both the motel and the competitor experience a significant **drop** in occupancy, possibly due to external factors such as **renovations** or **seasonal changes**.
- **Final Trends**: By the **end of the observation period**, the occupancy rates of both the motel and its competitor begin to **recover**.


## **3. Regression Model: Relationship Between Motel and Competitor Occupancy Rates**
To quantify this relationship, we estimate the following regression model:

$$MOTEL_{PCT} = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \cdot COMP_{PCT} + e$$

Where:
- $MOTEL$ _ $PCT$ = Motel occupancy rate
- $COMP$ _ $PCT$ = Competitor occupancy rate
- $\beta_1$ = Intercept (baseline motel occupancy when $COMP\_PCT = 0$)
- $\beta_2$ = Effect of competitor occupancy on motel occupancy
- $e$ = Error term (captures unexplained factors)

Using R:

```r
# Perform linear regression
model <- lm(motel_pct ~ comp_pct, data = motel_data)

# Display regression summary
summary(model)
```


**Summary Statistics**

| Term | Estimate | Std. Error | t Value | Pr(>t) |
|------|----------|------------|---------|----|
| Intercept      | 21.4000   | 12.9069    | 1.658   | 0.1109     |
| Slope          | 0.8646    | 0.2027     | 4.265   | 0.0003     |


**Residual Analysis:**
- **Min Residual**: -23.876
- **1st Quartile**: -4.909
- **Median**: -1.193
- **3rd Quartile**: 5.312
- **Max Residual**: 26.818


## **4. Model Fit and Significance**

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| **Multiple $R^2$** | 0.4417 |
| **Adjusted $R^2$** | 0.4174 |
| **Residual Standard Error** | 11.02 (on 23 degrees of freedom) |
| **F-statistic** | 18.19 (on 1 and 23 DF) |
| **p-value** | 0.0002906 |


## **5. Interpretation**

### **ðŸ”¹ Effect of Competitor Occupancy on Motel Occupancy**

- The **slope coefficient** $(\beta_2 = 0.8646)$ suggests that **for every 1% increase in COMP_PCT, the motel's occupancy rate increases by approximately 0.86%**.

- Since **$p = 0.0003$**, this effect is **highly statistically significant (p < 0.001)**.

### **ðŸ”¹ Model Fit**

- The **$R^2 = 0.4417$** indicates that **44.17% of the variance in MOTEL_PCT is explained by COMP_PCT**.

- This suggests a **moderate relationship**, meaning other factors might also be influencing motel occupancy.

### **ðŸ”¹ Confidence in the Estimates**

- The **standard error for $\beta_2$** is **0.2027**, and its 95% confidence interval can be computed as:

  ```r
  confint(model, level = 0.95)

  ```

Competitor occupancy has a significant positive effect on motel occupancy ($p < 0.001$).

The model explains 44.17% of the variance in motel occupancy, indicating a moderate relationship.

Additional factors should be considered for a more comprehensive model.
