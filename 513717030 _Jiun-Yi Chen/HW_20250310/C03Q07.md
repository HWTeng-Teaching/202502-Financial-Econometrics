### Part (a)
We need to calculate the estimated intercept $(a)$ using the provided information.

From the regression equation:
$\widehat{INCOME}=a+1.029\times BACHELOR$

The $t$-statistic for the intercept is given as:
$t_a=\frac{a}{\text{SE}(a)}$

Given:
$t_a=4.31, \quad \text{SE}(a)=2.672$

Solving for $a$:
$a=t_a\times \text{SE}(a)=4.31\times2.672=11.52$

Thus, the estimated regression equation is:
$\widehat{INCOME}=11.52+1.029\times BACHELOR$

---

### Part (b)
The estimated relationship follows the equation:

$\widehat{INCOME}=11.52+1.029\times BACHELOR$

- Since the slope coefficient $(1.029)$ is positive, the relationship between $BACHELOR$ and $INCOME$ is **increasing**.
- This indicates a **positive relationship**: as the percentage of people with a bachelor's degree increases, income per capita also increases.
- The equation represents a **linear** relationship, meaning that **income increases at a constant rate** with respect to the percentage of individuals holding a bachelor's degree.

### Part (c)
From the formula for the t-statistic:

$$t=\frac{\hat{\beta}_2}{se(\hat{\beta}_2)}$$

We solve for $se(\hat{\beta}_2)$:

$$10.75=\frac{1.029}{se(\hat{\beta}_2)}$$

$$se(\hat{\beta}_2)=\frac{1.029}{10.75}=0.0958$$

Thus, the standard error of the slope coefficient is **$0.0958$**.

### Part (d)
We need to calculate the $t$-statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the intercept parameter equals $10$.
We test:
- **Null Hypothesis**: $H_0: \hat{\alpha}=10$
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_A: \hat{\alpha}\neq10$

The test statistic formula is:

$t = \frac{\hat{a} - a_0}{\text{SE}(\hat{a})}$

where:
- $\hat{a}$ = 11.52 (estimated intercept from part (a))
- $a_0 = 10$ (hypothesized value)
- $\text{SE}(\hat{a}) = 2.672$

Substituting the values:

$t = \frac{11.52 - 10}{2.672} = \frac{1.52}{2.672} \approx 0.569$

Thus, the $t$-statistic is **0.569**.

### Part (e)
The p-value for a two-tailed test with $t = 0.569$ is given as **0.572**.

To visualize this, one can sketch a standard t-distribution with **two rejection regions** at the tails for $\alpha = 0.05$. The critical values for a two-tailed test at $\alpha = 0.05$ with $df = 50$ (approximate) are:

$t_{0.025, 50} \approx \pm2.009$

Since $|t| = 0.569$ is far inside the acceptance region, we fail to reject $H_0$.

---

### Part (f)
We construct a 99% confidence interval for the slope $\beta_1$ using:

$$\hat{\beta_1}\pm t_{\alpha/2, df}\times se(\hat{\beta_1})$$

where:
- $\hat{\beta}_1 = 1.029$
- $\text{se}(\hat{\beta}_1) = 0.0958$
- $t_{0.005, 50} \approx 2.68$

Substituting the values:

$1.029 \pm 2.68 \times 0.0958$

$1.029 \pm 0.2568$

$(0.772, 1.286)$

**Interpretation:** We are 99% confident that the true slope lies between **0.772 and 1.286**. Since the confidence interval does not contain zero, this suggests a strong positive relationship between $BACHELOR$ and $INCOME$.

---

### Part (g)
We test the null hypothesis:

$H_0: \beta_1 = 1, \quad H_A: \beta_1 \neq 1$

The test statistic is:

$t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1 - 1}{\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_1)}$

Substituting the values:

$t = \frac{1.029 - 1}{0.0958} = \frac{0.029}{0.0958} \approx 0.303$

For a two-tailed test at $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value is:

$t_{0.025, 50} \approx \pm2.009$

Since $|t| = 0.303$ is much smaller than $2.009$, we fail to reject $H_0$.

**Economic Conclusion:** There is no statistically significant evidence to suggest that the slope is different from $1$. This implies that a $1\%$ increase in the proportion of people with a bachelor's degree is associated with approximately a $1\%$ increase in income per capita, supporting the hypothesis that education has a proportional effect on income.
