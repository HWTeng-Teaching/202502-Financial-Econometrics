## a.
The capital asset pricing model (CAPM):\
$r_j - r_f = \alpha_j + \beta_j (r_m - r_f) + \epsilon_j$
\
The model is a simple regression model because it can be written as $y = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x +e$

$y = r_j - r_f , x = r_m - r_f , \beta_1 = \alpha ,\beta_2 = \beta_j$
\
The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is an important model in the field of finance. It explains variations in the rate of return on a security as a function of the rate of return on a portfolio consisting of all publicly traded stocks, which is called the *market portfolio*. Generally, the rate of return on any investment is measured relative to its opportunity cost, which is the return on a risk-free asset. The resulting difference is called the *risk premium*, since it is the reward or punishment for making a risky investment. The CAPM says that the risk premium in security \( j \) is *proportional* to the risk premium on the market portfolio. That is,

$r_j - r_f = \beta_j (r_m - r_f)$

where \( r_j \) and \( r_f \) are the returns to security \( j \) and the risk-free rate, respectively, \( r_m \) is the return on the market portfolio, and \( \beta_j \) is the security’s *beta* value. A stock’s *beta* is important to investors since it reveals the stock’s volatility. It measures the sensitivity of security \( j \)’s return to variation in the whole stock market. As such, values of \( \beta \) less than one indicate that the stock is *defensive* since its variation is less than the market’s. A beta greater than one indicates an *aggressive stock*. Investors usually want an estimate of a stock’s *beta* before purchasing it. The CAPM model shown above is the *economic model* in this case. The *econometric model* is obtained by including an intercept in the model (even though theory says it should be zero) and an error term:

$r_j - r_f = \alpha_j + \beta_j (r_m - r_f) + \epsilon_j$
