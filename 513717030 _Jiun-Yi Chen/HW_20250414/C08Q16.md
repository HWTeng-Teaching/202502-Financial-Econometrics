## (b)
Plot residuals of income and age:

INCOME:
![Q16 B1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5edd6f3b-77c3-44cb-8f51-3908302042bb)

*Check whether heteroskedasticity exists:*

We can find that the residuals are more widely dispersed at higher levels of INCOME, this implies that high‑income households exhibit greater variability in miles traveled. we should then perform a White test to confirm.

AGE:
![Q16 B2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edcfe4f7-05ab-453d-9517-f556851d43e2)

*Check whether heteroskedasticity exists:*

We can find that the residuals don't “fan out” (i.e. form a funnel shape),and the residuals are scattered evenly around the horizontal line, with no obvious pattern. We can provisionally assume homoskedasticity.

## (c)
using the Goldfeld-Quandt test:
```
Goldfeld-Quandt test

data:  MILES ~ INCOME + AGE + KIDS
GQ = 3.1041, df1 = 86, df2 = 86, p-value = 1.64e-07
alternative hypothesis: variance increases from segment 1 to 2
```
**H₀**  
The error variances are equal between the low‐income and high‐income groups.  
$H_0: \sigma^2_{\text{first 90}} = \sigma^2_{\text{last 90}}$

**H₁**  
The error variance in the high‐income group exceeds that in the low‐income group.  
$H_1: \sigma^2_{\text{last 90}} > \sigma^2_{\text{first 90}}$




**Decision at $\alpha = 0.05$**

1. Critical value:  
   $F_{0.95}(86,86)\approx1.4286$

2. Since  
   GQ = 3.1041 > 1.4286 
   (equivalently, p < 0.05), we reject 
   $H_0: \sigma^2_{\text{first 90}} = \sigma^2_{\text{last 90}}$

4. **Conclusion**: The error variance in the high‑income group (last 90 observations) is significantly larger than in the low‑income group (first 90 observations), indicating heteroskedasticity.
