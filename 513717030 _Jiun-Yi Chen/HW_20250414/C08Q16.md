## (b)
Plot residuls of income and age:

INCOME:
![Q16 B1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5edd6f3b-77c3-44cb-8f51-3908302042bb)

*Check whether heteroskedasticity exists:*

We can find that the residuals are more widely dispersed at higher levels of INCOME, this implies that high‑income households exhibit greater variability in miles traveled. we should then perform a White test to confirm.

AGE:
![Q16 B2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edcfe4f7-05ab-453d-9517-f556851d43e2)

*Check whether heteroskedasticity exists:*

We can find that the residuals don't “fan out” (i.e. form a funnel shape),and the residuals are scattered evenly around the horizontal line, with no obvious pattern. We can provisionally assume homoskedasticity.
