## (a)
Expected Signs

    β2 (coefficient on QUANT)

        Likely sign: Negative.

        Reasoning: In many illicit (and legal) markets, buying in bulk often comes with a discount, meaning the price per gram tends to decrease as the total quantity purchased increases. Thus, as QUANT goes up, PRICE per gram is expected to go down.

    β3 (coefficient on QUAL)

        Likely sign: Positive.

        Reasoning: Higher purity (quality) should command a higher price per gram. Hence, an increase in QUAL is expected to increase the PRICE.

    β4​ (coefficient on TREND)

        Likely sign: Negative or Ambiguous (depending on market conditions).

        Reasoning:

            If the real price of cocaine was falling over this period (e.g., due to increased supply, competition, or enforcement patterns), we would expect a negative sign.

            In some contexts, prices might have risen over time (inflation or rising demand), in which case the sign could be positive.

## (b)
The estimated regression equation is:

$$
\widehat{\text{PRICE}} = 90.8467 - 0.0600 \cdot \text{QUANT} + 0.1162 \cdot \text{QUAL} - 2.3546 \cdot \text{TREND}
$$

Standard errors (in parentheses below coefficients):

$$
(\text{se}) = (8.5803,\; 0.0102,\; 0.2033,\; 1.3861)
$$

$t$-values:

$$
(t) = (10.588,\; -5.892,\; 0.5717,\; -1.6987)
$$

Interpretation:

- $\beta_2 = -0.0600$: for each 1-unit increase in quantity, the price decreases by \$0.06.
- $\beta_3 = 0.1162$: for each 1-unit increase in quality, the price increases by \$0.1162.
- $\beta_4 = -2.3546$: for each additional year, the price decreases by \$2.3546 on average.

All coefficients have the expected signs.

### (c) $R^2$ and Explanation

The proportion of variation in cocaine price explained by QUANT, QUAL, and TREND is:

$$
R^2 = 0.5097
$$

This means 50.97% of the variation in price is explained by the model.

### (d) Hypothesis Test for Quantity Discount

**Hypotheses:**

- $H_0: \beta_2 \geq 0$
- $H_1: \beta_2 < 0$

**Test Statistic:**

$$
t = \frac{-0.05997}{0.01018} = -5.892
$$

Critical value at $\alpha = 0.05$ (one-tailed, df = 52): $t_{0.05, 52} = -1.675$

Since $-5.892 < -1.675$, we **reject** $H_0$. There is strong evidence that sellers offer discounts for larger quantities.

### (e) Hypothesis Test for Quality Premium

**Hypotheses:**

- $H_0: \beta_3 \leq 0$
- $H_1: \beta_3 > 0$

**Test Statistic:**

$$
t = \frac{0.1162}{0.2033} = 0.5717
$$

Critical value at $\alpha = 0.05$ (one-tailed): $t_{0.05, 52} = 1.675$

Since $0.5717 < 1.675$, we **fail to reject** $H_0$. There is **no statistical evidence** of a quality premium at the 5% significance level.

### (f) Annual Price Trend

The estimated coefficient for time (TREND) is:

$$
\beta_4 = -2.3546
$$

This implies the average annual **decrease in price** is \$2.35.

The negative sign may reflect an increase in supply over time, potentially due to improved production efficiency or greater market competition.
