## (b) Interpret Each Estimated Coefficient: b₁, b₂, and b₄

    b₁ (Coefficient on ln(TOTEXP))

        Estimate: 2.7648

        Interpretation: Holding all other variables constant, a one-unit increase in ln(TOTEXP) (i.e., an approximately 100% increase in TOTEXP) is associated with an increase of about 2.7648 in WALC (the budget share spent on alcohol).

        Elasticity Interpretation: If you interpret the change in terms of percentages, a 1% increase in TOTEXP (which approximately increases ln(TOTEXP) by 0.01) is associated with an increase in WALC of about 0.027648 (i.e., roughly 2.76 percentage points if WALC is expressed as a proportion).

    b₂ (Coefficient on NK)

        Estimate: –0.3974

        Interpretation: Holding other factors constant, each additional child in the household is associated with a decrease in the alcohol budget share (WALC) of about 0.3974.

        Statistical Significance: With a t‑Statistic of –6.41 and a p‑value of 0.0000, this effect is highly statistically significant.

    b₄ (Coefficient on AGE)

        Estimate: –0.0150

        Interpretation: Holding other variables constant, each additional year in the head of household’s age is associated with a decrease in WALC of about 0.0150.

        Statistical Significance: With a t‑Statistic of –6.40 and a p‑value of 0.0000, the effect of AGE on WALC is also highly significant.


## (c) Calculate the 95% Confidence Interval for b₁ and Explain Its Meaning

    Given:

        b₁ = 2.7648

        Std. Error for b₁ = 0.484

    Calculation:
    The 95% confidence interval is computed as:
    b1±1.96×Std. Error=2.7648±1.96×0.484
    b1​±1.96×Std. Error=2.7648±1.96×0.484
    =2.7648±0.949=(1.8158,  3.7138)
    =2.7648±0.949=(1.8158,3.7138)

    Interpretation:
    in reapted sampling, the confidence interval we constructed will 95% contain the true population coefficient for ln(TOTEXP) (i.e., the true effect of ln(TOTEXP) on WALC) lies between approximately 1.82 and 3.71. Since this entire interval is above zero, it confirms a statistically significant positive relationship between ln(TOTEXP) and WALC.

## (d) Are the Coefficients Statistically Significant at the 5% Level? Explain

    ln(TOTEXP) (b₁):

        t‑Statistic = 5.71, p‑Value = 0.0000 (< 0.05) → Significant

    NK (b₂):

        t‑Statistic = –6.41, p‑Value = 0.0000 (< 0.05) → Significant

    AGE (b₄):

        t‑Statistic = –6.40, p‑Value = 0.0000 (< 0.05) → Significant

    Intercept (C):

        t‑Statistic = 0.66, p‑Value = 0.5099 (> 0.05) → Not Significant

Conclusion: At the 5% significance level, all coefficients except the intercept are statistically significant. This means we have strong evidence that ln(TOTEXP), NK, and AGE affect WALC.

## (e) Hypothesis Test: Does an Additional Child Reduce the Mean Budget Share of Alcohol by Exactly 2 Percentage Points?

We are testing the following hypothesis at the 5% significance level:

    Null Hypothesis (H₀): The coefficient on NK is exactly –0.02 (i.e., an extra child decreases WALC by 2 percentage points).

    Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The coefficient on NK is not equal to –0.02.

    Test Statistic Calculation:
    Given:

        Estimated b₂ = –0.3974

        Standard Error for b₂ = 0.062
        
Using the estimate $b_2 = -0.3974$ and its standard error $0.062$, the test statistic is calculated as:
$$t = \frac{-0.3974 - (-0.02)}{0.062} = \frac{-0.3774}{0.062} \approx -6.08.$$

Decision Rule:
For a two‑tailed test at the 5% level, the critical value is approximately ±1.96. Since |–6.08| is much greater than 1.96, we reject the null hypothesis.

Conclusion:
We reject the null hypothesis that an extra child decreases the mean alcohol budget share by exactly 2 percentage points. Instead, the estimated effect is about –0.3974, which indicates a much larger negative impact.
