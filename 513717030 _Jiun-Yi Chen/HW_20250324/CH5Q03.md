**題目要求:**

| 項目                               | 補全值    |
|------------------------------------|-----------|
| t-Statistic for $\beta_1$          | 0.6594    |
| Std. Error for $\beta_2$           | 0.4842    |
| Estimate for $\beta_3$ (NK)        | -1.4549   |
| R-squared                          | 0.0575    |
| Standard Error of Regression ($\hat{\sigma}$) | 6.217     |

## (b) Interpret Each Estimated Coefficient: b₁, b₂, and b₄

  - **$\hat{\beta}_2 = 2.765$ (lnTOTEXP)**  
  This means that a 1% increase in total household expenditure is associated with approximately a **2.76 percentage point increase** in the share of the household budget allocated to alcohol.  
  Since the independent variable is in log form and the dependent variable is in level form, the interpretation is **semi-elastic**.

- **$\hat{\beta}_3 = -1.4549$ (NK)**  
  An additional child in the household reduces the alcohol budget share by approximately **1.45 percentage points**, holding other factors constant.  
  This is a **level-level** interpretation.

- **$\hat{\beta}_4 = -0.1503$ (AGE)**  
  Each additional year of age of the household head is associated with a **0.15 percentage point decrease** in the alcohol budget share, holding other variables constant.


## (c) Calculate the 95% Confidence Interval for b₁ and Explain Its Meaning

Given:
$b_4$ = −0.1503

Std. Error for $b_4$ = 0.0235

Calculation:
[−0.1503±1.96⋅0.0235]=[−0.1964,−0.1042]

**Interpretation:**

   In repeated sampling, the 95% confidence interval for the population coefficient on AGE is approximately from –0.1964 to –0.1042.
Since this interval lies entirely below zero, we conclude that there is a statistically significant negative relationship between age and WALC.

## (d) Are the Coefficients Statistically Significant at the 5% Level? Explain

   To test significance at the 5% level, we compare the p-values to 0.05:

- **$\beta_1$ (intercept)**: Not statistically significant ($p = 0.5099 > 0.05$)
- **$\beta_2$ (lnTOTEXP)**: Statistically significant ($p < 0.0001$)
- **$\beta_3$ (NK)**: Statistically significant ($p = 0.0001$)
- **$\beta_4$ (AGE)**: Statistically significant ($p < 0.0001$)

### Conclusion:
With the exception of the intercept, all coefficient estimates are significantly different from zero at a 5% level because their p-values are all less than 0.05. 

## (e) Hypothesis Test: Does an Additional Child Reduce the Mean Budget Share of Alcohol by Exactly 2 Percentage Points?

We test the following hypotheses:

- $H_0: \beta_3 = -2$
- $H_1: \beta_3 \neq -2$

### Step 1: Compute the test statistic

$$t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_3 - (-2)}{SE(\hat{\beta}_3)} = \frac{-1.4549 - (-2)}{0.3695} = 1.4752$$

### Step 2: Determine critical value

At a 5% significance level (two-tailed), the critical value is:

$$\pm 1.96$$

### Step 3: Compare $t$-value to critical value

Since $1.4752 < 1.96$, we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis.

### Conclusion:

There is **insufficient evidence** to conclude that the effect of an extra child differs from a 2 percentage point decrease in the alcohol budget share at the 5% level.
