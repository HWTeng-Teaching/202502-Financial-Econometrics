### From the images and the result from the R: 
Characteristics of WAGE (Hourly Wage):

Most people earn between $10 and $20 per hour.

The distribution is right-skewed, meaning most people have lower wages, with just a few earning very high wages.

Because of a few very high earners, the average wage is usually higher than the median wage.

Characteristics of EDUC (Years of Education):

Most people have 12 years (high school) or 16 years (college) of education.

The data has clear peaks at these common levels: finishing high school (12 years) and finishing college (16 years).

There's also a smaller peak at higher education levels (18 years or more, for graduate degrees).
