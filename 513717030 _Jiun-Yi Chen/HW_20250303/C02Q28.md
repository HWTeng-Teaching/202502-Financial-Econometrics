### From the images and the result from the R: 
Characteristics of WAGE (Hourly Wage):

Most people earn between $10 and $20 per hour.

The distribution is right-skewed, meaning most people have lower wages, with just a few earning very high wages.

Because of a few very high earners, the average wage is usually higher than the median wage.

Characteristics of EDUC (Years of Education):

Most people have 12 years (high school) or 16 years (college) of education.

The data has clear peaks at these common levels: finishing high school (12 years) and finishing college (16 years).

There's also a smaller peak at higher education levels (18 years or more, for graduate degrees).

### From the result from the R:
The linear regression model is

$\hat{y}= -10.4 + 2.3968 x $

Slope (EDUC): 2.3968

On average, hourly wages increase by approximately $2.40 for each additional year of education.

This coefficient is highly significant (p-value < 2e-16), indicating that years of education significantly affect wages.

Adjusted R-squared: 0.2067

This means about 20.67% of the variation in wages is explained by education alone. Other factors also influence wages.

F-statistic: 313.3 (p-value < 2.2e-16)

This strongly supports the statistical significance of the overall regression model, indicating a strong relationship between education level and wages.

```
linear_model <- lm(wage ~ educ, data = data)
summary(linear_model)

### From the image and the result from the R:
I created a plot of the residuals against EDUC, revealing a distinct pattern:

As EDUC increases, the residuals also become larger.

This suggests that the error variance grows with education, violating assumption SR3.

If all assumptions SR1–SR5 hold, the residuals should not exhibit any noticeable patterns like this.

```
# Create a linear regression model (if not already established)
model <- lm(wage ~ educ, data = data)

# Calculate and store residuals
data$residuals <- residuals(model)

# View previous residuals
head(data$residuals)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data, aes(x = educ, y = residuals)) +
  geom_point(color = "green4", alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "tan3", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Residuals vs. EDUC",
       x = "Years of Education (EDUC)",
       y = "Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()
