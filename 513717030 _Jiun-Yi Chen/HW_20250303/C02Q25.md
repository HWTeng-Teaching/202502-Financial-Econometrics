We found that 178 observations in FOODAWAY are ≤ 0.
### Explain why FOODAWAY and ln(FOODAWAY) have different numbers of observations:
Anwser: The difference in observation counts occurs because ln(FOODAWAY) is undefined for FOODAWAY ≤ 0, leading to NA values, which are not counted as valid observations.

```
# 要先安裝dplyr並載入
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
# 檢查是否有 0 或負值，等等取log不要有o的值
sum(data$foodaway <= 0, na.rm = TRUE)

# 取自然對數，並排除 FOODAWAY ≤ 0 的情況
#  修正右偏分佈
#在許多消費數據中，像 foodaway 這類變數往往呈現右偏（skewed right）。
#這代表大部分人的 foodaway 值較小，但有少數人的 foodaway 值非常大（例如，高收入族群外食支出遠超過一般人）。
#取對數後，數據分佈會變得更接近常態分佈，有助於統計推論和回歸分析。
# 確保 foodaway 為正數，並過濾 NA 值
data <- data %>%
  filter(foodaway > 0) %>%
  mutate(ln_foodaway = log(foodaway))

# 檢查 ln_foodaway 的摘要統計

### ln(Foodaway) = 3.1293 + 0.0069 Income + e
Interpretation:
 1.Intercept: When Income is 0, the predicted value of ln⁡(Foodaway)ln(Foodaway) is 3.1293.

        Converting this back to the original scale of Foodaway:
$$\text{Foodaway} \approx e^{3.1293} \approx 22.9$$

        This means that if Income were 0, the expected Foodaway would be about 22.9 (depending on the units used).\
2. Income Coefficient (0.00690)

        This coefficient indicates that for every one-unit increase in Income, the expected value of ln(Foodaway) increases by 0.0069.

        Since only the dependent variable (Foodaway) is log-transformed while Income remains in its original units, this coefficient represents a semi-elasticity.\
   Conclusion:
A one-unit increase in Income is associated with an approximate 0.69% increase in Foodaway.

From a visual inspection of the residuals plot, there does not appear to be a clear or systematic pattern.
The OLS residuals do appear randomly distributed with no obvious patterns.
The points are relatively scattered around the horizontal zero line, suggesting:

**1. No Strong Trend**: There is no obvious upward or downward slope in the residuals across the range of income.

**2. No Pronounced Funnel Shape**: The spread of the residuals does not appear to widen or narrow systematically at higher or lower income levels, so there is no strong indication of heteroscedasticity.

**3. Random Distribution Around Zero**: Residuals are roughly centered around zero, which is generally consistent with the assumptions of a linear model (i.e., that errors have a mean of zero).
