We found that 178 observations in FOODAWAY are ≤ 0.
### Explain why FOODAWAY and ln(FOODAWAY) have different numbers of observations:
Anwser: The difference in observation counts occurs because ln(FOODAWAY) is undefined for FOODAWAY ≤ 0, leading to NA values, which are not counted as valid observations.

```
# 要先安裝dplyr並載入
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
# 檢查是否有 0 或負值，等等取log不要有o的值
sum(data$foodaway <= 0, na.rm = TRUE)

# 取自然對數，並排除 FOODAWAY ≤ 0 的情況
#  修正右偏分佈
#在許多消費數據中，像 foodaway 這類變數往往呈現右偏（skewed right）。
#這代表大部分人的 foodaway 值較小，但有少數人的 foodaway 值非常大（例如，高收入族群外食支出遠超過一般人）。
#取對數後，數據分佈會變得更接近常態分佈，有助於統計推論和回歸分析。
# 確保 foodaway 為正數，並過濾 NA 值
data <- data %>%
  filter(foodaway > 0) %>%
  mutate(ln_foodaway = log(foodaway))

# 檢查 ln_foodaway 的摘要統計

### ln(Foodaway) = 3.1293 + 0.0069 Income + e
Interpretation:
 1.Intercept: When Income is 0, the predicted value of ln⁡(Foodaway)ln(Foodaway) is 3.1293.

        Converting this back to the original scale of Foodaway:
$$\text{Foodaway} \approx e^{3.1293} \approx 22.9$$

        This means that if Income were 0, the expected Foodaway would be about 22.9 (depending on the units used).\
2. Income Coefficient (0.00690)

        This coefficient indicates that for every one-unit increase in Income, the expected value of ln(Foodaway) increases by 0.0069.

        Since only the dependent variable (Foodaway) is log-transformed while Income remains in its original units, this coefficient represents a semi-elasticity.\
   Conclusion:
A one-unit increase in Income is associated with an approximate 0.69% increase in Foodaway.

From a visual inspection of the residuals plot, there does not appear to be a clear or systematic pattern.
The OLS residuals do appear randomly distributed with no obvious patterns.
The points are relatively scattered around the horizontal zero line, suggesting:
1. No Strong Trend: There is no obvious upward or downward slope in the residuals across the range of income.
2. No Pronounced Funnel Shape: The spread of the residuals does not appear to widen or narrow systematically at higher or lower income levels, so there is no strong indication of heteroscedasticity.
3. Random Distribution Around Zero: Residuals are roughly centered around zero, which is generally consistent with the assumptions of a linear model (i.e., that errors have a mean of zero).
