**Answer:**

- **Model 1**: \(\text{RATING} = 64.289 + 0.990 \times \text{EXPER}\)
- If we let **EXPER** vary from 0 to 30:
  - At **EXPER = 0**:
    \[
      \text{RATING} = 64.289 + 0.990 \times 0 = 64.289
    \]
  - At **EXPER = 30**:
    \[
      \text{RATING} = 64.289 + 0.990 \times 30 = 64.289 + 29.70 = 93.989
    \]
- Plotting these points and connecting them with a straight line would produce a line that starts at approximately 64.289 (when EXPER=0) and goes up to about 93.989 (when EXPER=30).
