### 5.31 Each morning between $6:30_{AM}$ and $8:00_{AM}$ Bill leaves the Melbourne suburb of Carnegie to drive to work at the University of Melbourne. The time it takes Bill to drive to work *(TIME)*, depends on the departure time *(DEPART)*, the number of red lights that he encounters *(REDS)*, and the number of trains that he has to wait for at the Murrumbeena level crossing *(TRAINS)*. Observations on these variables for the 249 working days in 2015 appear in the file *commute5*. *TIME* is measured in minutes. *DEPART* is the number of minutes after  $6:30_{AM}$ that Bill departs.

#### a. Estimate the equation
$$
TIME = \beta_1 + \beta_2DEPART + \beta_3REDS + \beta_4TRAINS + e
$$
#### Report the results and interpret each of the coefficient estimates, including the intercept $\beta_1$.

$$
TIME = 20.8701 + 0.3681DEPART + 1.5219REDS + 3.0237TRAINS
$$

#### b. Find 95% interval estimates for each of the coefficients. Have you obtained precise estimates of each of the coefficients?

#### c. Using a 5% significance level, test the null hypothesis that Billâ€™s expected delay from each red light is 2 minutes or more against the alternative that it is less than 2 minutes.

#### d. Using a 10% significance level, test the null hypothesis that the expected delay from each train is 3 minutes against the alternative that it is not 3 minutes.

#### e. Using a 5% significance level, test the null hypothesis that Bill can expect a trip to be at least 10 minutes longer if he leaves at $7:30_{AM}$ instead of $7:00_{AM}$, against the alternative that it will not be 10 minutes longer. (Assume other things are equal.)

#### f. Using a 5% significance level, test the null hypothesis that the expected delay from a train is at least three times greater than the expected delay from a red light against the alternative that it is less than three times greater.

#### g. Suppose that Bill encounters six red lights and one train. Using a 5% significance level, test the null hypothesis that leaving Carnegie at $7:00_{AM}$ is early enough to get him to the university on or before $7:45_{AM}$ against the alternative that it is not. [Carry out the test in terms of the expected time *E(TIME|X)* where X represents the observations on all explanatory variables.]

#### h. Suppose that, in part (g), it is imperative that Bill is not late for his $7:45_{AM}$ meeting. Have the null and alternative hypotheses been set up correctly? What happens if these hypotheses are reversed?
