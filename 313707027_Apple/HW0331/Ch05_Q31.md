### 5.31 Each morning between $6:30_{AM}$ and $8:00_{AM}$ Bill leaves the Melbourne suburb of Carnegie to drive to work at the University of Melbourne. The time it takes Bill to drive to work *(TIME)*, depends on the departure time *(DEPART)*, the number of red lights that he encounters *(REDS)*, and the number of trains that he has to wait for at the Murrumbeena level crossing *(TRAINS)*. Observations on these variables for the 249 working days in 2015 appear in the file *commute5*. *TIME* is measured in minutes. *DEPART* is the number of minutes after  $6:30_{AM}$ that Bill departs.

#### a. Estimate the equation
$$
TIME = \beta_1 + \beta_2DEPART + \beta_3REDS + \beta_4TRAINS + e
$$
#### Report the results and interpret each of the coefficient estimates, including the intercept $\beta_1$.

$$
TIME = 20.8701 + 0.3681DEPART + 1.5219REDS + 3.0237TRAINS
$$

- $\beta_1 = 20.8701$:     
When DEPART, REDS, and TRAINS are all zero, the expected value of TIME is 20.8701.
This is the baseline travel time when no delay factors are present.
In practical terms, this might represent the minimum travel time under ideal conditions.

- $\beta_2 = 0.3681$ for DEPART:     
For each additional unit increase in DEPART, TIME increases by 0.3681 units, holding all else constant.
Interpretation depends on what DEPART measures (e.g., minutes after scheduled time). If DEPART is the departure delay, then:
A 1-minute increase in departure delay increases total travel time by about 0.37 minutes.

- $\beta_3 = 1.5219$ for REDS:     
For each additional red signal encountered (REDS), TIME increases by 1.5219 units.
This suggests that each red signal adds roughly 1.5 minutes to the total travel time.

- $\beta_4 = 3.0237$ for TRAINS:     
For each additional train encountered (TRAINS), TIME increases by 3.0237 units.
This implies encountering a train is quite costly in time—about 3 minutes per train.

#### b. Find 95% interval estimates for each of the coefficients. Have you obtained precise estimates of each of the coefficients?

- The coefficient estimates for DEPART and REDS are quite precise, with narrow intervals.
- The TRAINS coefficient is less precise, but the interval does not include zero, indicating it is statistically significant.
- The intercept has the widest interval, but since it's often not of primary interest in interpretation, that's acceptable.

#### c. Using a 5% significance level, test the null hypothesis that Bill’s expected delay from each red light is 2 minutes or more against the alternative that it is less than 2 minutes.

$H_0: \beta_3 \geq 2$    
$H_1: \beta_3 < 2$    

$t = \frac{1.5219-2}{0.1850} = -2.5843 < t_{(0.05, 245)} = -1.6511$, which falls in the rejection region, so we reject $H_0$. 

#### d. Using a 10% significance level, test the null hypothesis that the expected delay from each train is 3 minutes against the alternative that it is not 3 minutes.

$H_0: \beta_4 = 3$    
$H_1: \beta_4 \neq 3$    

$t = \frac{3.0237-3}{0.6340} = 0.0374 < t_{(0.95, 245)} = 1.6511$, which **NOT** falls in the rejection region, so we cannot reject $H_0$. 

#### e. Using a 5% significance level, test the null hypothesis that Bill can expect a trip to be at least 10 minutes longer if he leaves at $7:30_{AM}$ instead of $7:00_{AM}$, against the alternative that it will not be 10 minutes longer. (Assume other things are equal.)

$H_0: 60\beta_2 - 30\beta_2 \geq 10 \Rightarrow \beta_2 \geq \frac{1}{3}$       
$H_1: 60\beta_2 - 30\beta_2 < 10 \Rightarrow \beta_2 < \frac{1}{3}$    

$t = \frac{0.3681- \frac{1}{3}}{0.0351} = 0.9905 > t_{(0.05, 245)} = -1.6511$, which **NOT** falls in the rejection region, so we cannot reject $H_0$. 

#### f. Using a 5% significance level, test the null hypothesis that the expected delay from a train is at least three times greater than the expected delay from a red light against the alternative that it is less than three times greater.

$H_0: \beta_4 \geq 3\beta_3$        
$H_1: \beta_4 < 3\beta_3$    

$t = \frac{\beta_4- 3\beta_3}{se(\beta_4- 3\beta_3)} = \frac{-1.5420}{0.844992} = -1.8249 < t_{(0.05, 245)} = -1.6511$, which falls in the rejection region, so we reject $H_0$.

#### g. Suppose that Bill encounters six red lights and one train. Using a 5% significance level, test the null hypothesis that leaving Carnegie at $7:00_{AM}$ is early enough to get him to the university on or before $7:45_{AM}$ against the alternative that it is not. [Carry out the test in terms of the expected time *E(TIME|X)* where X represents the observations on all explanatory variables.]

$H_0: \beta_1 + 30\beta_2 + 6\beta_3 +\beta_4 \leq 45$        
$H_1: \beta_1 + 30\beta_2 + 6\beta_3 +\beta_4 > 45$      

$t = \frac{E(TIME|X)- 45}{se(E(TIME|X)- 45)} = \frac{44.06924-45}{0.5392687} = -1.7260 < t_{(0.95, 245)} = 1.6511$, which **NOT** falls in the rejection region, so we cannot reject $H_0$. 

#### h. Suppose that, in part (g), it is imperative that Bill is not late for his $7:45_{AM}$ meeting. Have the null and alternative hypotheses been set up correctly? What happens if these hypotheses are reversed?

$H_0: \beta_1 + 30\beta_2 + 6\beta_3 +\beta_4 \geq 45$        
$H_1: \beta_1 + 30\beta_2 + 6\beta_3 +\beta_4 < 45$      

$t = \frac{E(TIME|X)- 45}{se(E(TIME|X)- 45)} = \frac{44.06924-45}{0.5392687} = -1.7260 < t_{(0.05, 245)} = -1.6511$, which falls in the rejection region, so we reject $H_0$.
