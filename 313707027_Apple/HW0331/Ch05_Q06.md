### Using a 5% significance level, and an alternative hypothesis that the equality does not hold, test each of the following null hypotheses:
---
#### a. $\beta_2$ = 0

$H_0: \beta_2 = 0$    
$H_1: \beta_2 \neq 0$    

$t = \frac{3-0}{\sqrt{4}} = 1.5 < t_{(0.995, 60)} = 2$, which **NOT** falls in the rejection region, so we cannot reject $H_0$. 


#### b.  $\beta_1 + 2\beta_2$ = 5

$H_0: \beta_1 + 2\beta_2 = 5$    
$H_1: \beta_1 + 2\beta_2 \neq 5$    

$t = \frac{8-5}{\sqrt{11}} = 0.905 < t_{(0.995, 60)} = 2$, which **NOT** falls in the rejection region, so we cannot reject $H_0$. 


#### c.  $\beta_1 - \beta_2 + \beta_3$ = 4 

$H_0: \beta_1 - \beta_2 + \beta_3 = 4$    
$H_1: \beta_1 - \beta_2 + \beta_3 \neq 4$ 

$t = \frac{-2-4}{\sqrt{16}} = -1.5 < t_{(0.025, 60)} = -2$, which **NOT** falls in the rejection region, so we cannot reject $H_0$.
