### 5.6 Suppose that, from a sample of 63 observations, the least squares estimates and the corresponding estimated covariance matrix are given by

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3
\end{bmatrix}

=\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\ 3 \\ -1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\widehat{\text{cov}}(b_1, b_2, b_3) =
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & -2 & 1 \\
-2 & 4 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
$$


### Using a 5% significance level, and an alternative hypothesis that the equality does not hold, test each of the following null hypotheses:
