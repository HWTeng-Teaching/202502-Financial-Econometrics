### 3.17 Consider the regression model $WAGE = β_1 +β_2EDUC +e$,where $WAGE$ is hourly wage rate in U.S.  2013 dollars and $EDUC$ is years of education, or schooling. The model is estimated twice, once using individuals from an urban area, and again for individuals in a rural area.


$$ Urban \quad \widehat{WAGE} = -10.76 + 2.46 \cdot EDUC, \quad N = 986 $$
$$ (se) \qquad \quad  (2.27) \qquad (0.16) \qquad$$

$$ Rural \quad \widehat{WAGE} = -4.88 + 1.80 \cdot EDUC, \quad N = 214 $$
$$(se) \qquad \quad  (3.29)  \qquad (0.24) \qquad$$

#### a. Using the urban regression, test the null hypothesis that the regression slope equals 1.80 against the alternative that it is greater than 1.80. Use the $\alpha = 0.05$ level of significance. Show all steps, including a graph of the critical region and state your conclusion.

$H_0: \beta_2=1.8$    
$H_1: \beta_2 > 1.8$    

$t = \frac{2.46-1.8}{0.46} = 4.125 < t_{(984, 0.05)} = 1.6464$, which falls in the rejection region, so we reject $H_0$ and accept $H_1$. 

#### b. Using the rural regression, compute a 95% interval estimate for expected $WAGE$ if $EDUC = 16$. The required standard error is 0.833. Show how it is calculated using the fact that the estimated covariance between the intercept and slope coefficients is −0.761.

$\mu = -4.88 + 1.8 \times 16 = 23.92$     

$95\\% \\, interval = \mu \pm t_{(0.025, 212)} \times se = 23.92 \pm 1.971217 \times 0.833 = [22.287, 25.553]$    

$se(\hat{WAGE}) = \sqrt{se(\hat{\beta_0})^2 + (EDUC)^2(se)(\beta_1)^2+2 \cdot EDUC \cdot cov(\beta_0,\beta_1)} = \sqrt{(3.29)^2 + (16)^2 (0.24)^2 - 2 \cdot 16 \cdot cov(\beta_0,\beta_1)}$     

$\Rightarrow cov(\beta_0,\beta_1) = \frac{(0.833)^2 - (3.29)^2 - (16)^2(0.24)^2}{2 \cdot 16}$    

#### c. Using the urban regression, compute a 95% interval estimate for expected $WAGE$ if $EDUC = 16$. The estimated covariance between the intercept and slope coefficients is −0.345. Is the interval estimate for the urban regression wider or narrower than that for the rural regression in (b). Do you find this plausible? Explain.

$\mu = -10.76 + 2.46 \times 16 = 28.6$    

$se(\hat{WAGE}) = \sqrt{(2.27)^2 + (0.16)^2 (16)^2 - 2 \cdot 16 \cdot 0.345} = 0.8164$    

$95\\% \\, interval = \mu \pm t_{(0.05)} \times se = 28.6 \pm 1.96 \times 0.8164 = [27.00, 30.20]$

#### d. Using the rural regression, test the hypothesis that the intercept parameter $\beta_1$ equals four, or more, against the alternative that it is less than four, at the 1% level of significance.

$H_0: \beta_1 \geq 4$    
$H_1: \beta_1 < 4$   

$t = \frac{-4.88-4}{3.29} = -2.6991 < t_{(212, 0.01)} = 2.3441$, which falls in the rejection region, so we reject $H_0$ and accept $H_1$.
