### 10.2 The labor supply of married women has been a subject of a great deal of economic research. Consider the following supply equation specification
$$
HOURS = \beta_1+ \beta_2WAGE + \beta_3EDUC + \beta_4AGE + \beta_5KIDSL6 + \beta_6NWIFEINC + e
$$
### where *HOURS* is the supply of labor, *WAGE* is hourly wage, *EDUC* is years of education, *KIDSL6* is the number of children in the household who are less than 6 years old, and *NWIFEINC* is household income from sources other than the wife’s employment.

#### a. Discuss the signs you expect for each of the coefficients.

| Variable   | Coefficient | Expected Sign  | Economic Reasoning                                                                 |
|------------|:-----------:|:--------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WAGE       | $\beta_2$   |       $+$      | Higher wage increases the incentive to work (substitution effect).                  |
| EDUC       | $\beta_3$   |       $+$      | More education improves job prospects and potential earnings.                       |
| AGE        | $\beta_4$   |      $\pm$     | Could increase or decrease labor supply depending on life stage and preferences.    |
| KIDSL6     | $\beta_5$   |       $−$      | More young children reduce time and flexibility for market work.                    |
| NWIFEINC   | $\beta_6$   |       $−$      | Higher non-wife income reduces financial pressure for the wife to work.             |

#### b. Explain why this supply equation cannot be consistently estimated by OLS regression.

The OLS estimation is likely inconsistent because **$WAGE$ is endogenous**. It is correlated with the error term, possibly due to unobserved factors like motivation or ability that affect both wages and labor supply. This violates the OLS assumption of exogeneity and leads to biased coefficient estimates.


#### c. Suppose we consider the woman’s labor market experience $EXPER$ and its square, $EXPER^2$, to be instruments for $WAGE$. Explain how these variables satisfy the logic of instrumental variables.

1. Relevance: They should be correlated with $WAGE$. Labor market experience typically affects wages through human capital accumulation.      
2. Exogeneity: They must be uncorrelated with the error term $e$ in the HOURS equation. That is, experience affects labor supply only through its effect on $WAGE$, not directly or through omitted variables.

If these conditions hold, $EXPER$ and $EXPER^2$ are valid instruments for $WAGE$.

#### d. Is the supply equation identified? Explain.

Yes, the equation is **identified**. Specifically, it is overidentified, because we are using two instruments $EXPER$ and $EXPER^2$ for a single endogenous variable $WAGE$. This allows us to estimate the model using IV or 2SLS, and also test the validity of the instruments.

#### e. Describe the steps [not a computer command] you would take to obtain IV/2SLS estimates.
1. Regress $WAGE$ on the instruments ($EXPER$ and $EXPER^2$) and all exogenous variables ($EDUC, AGE, KIDSL6, NWIFEINC$). Save the predicted values of $WAGE$.
2. Regress $HOURS$ on the predicted values of $WAGE$ from stage one, along with all other exogenous variables.
3. The coefficients from the second stage are the IV/2SLS estimates.
