### 10.2 The labor supply of married women has been a subject of a great deal of economic research. Consider the following supply equation specification
$$
HOURS = \beta_1+ \beta_2WAGE + \beta_3EDUC + \beta_4AGE + \beta_5KIDSL6 + \beta_6NWIFEINC + e
$$
### where *HOURS* is the supply of labor, *WAGE* is hourly wage, *EDUC* is years of education, *KIDSL6* is the number of children in the household who are less than 6 years old, and *NWIFEINC* is household income from sources other than the wife’s employment.

#### a. Discuss the signs you expect for each of the coefficients.

#### b. Explain why this supply equation cannot be consistently estimated by OLS regression.

#### c. Suppose we consider the woman’s labor market experience $EXPER$ and its square, $EXPER^2$, to be instruments for $WAGE$. Explain how these variables satisfy the logic of instrumental variables.

#### d. Is the supply equation identified? Explain.

#### e. Describe the steps [not a computer command] you would take to obtain IV/2SLS estimates.
