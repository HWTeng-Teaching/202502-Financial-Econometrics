## 2.1 Consider the following five observations. You are to do all the parts of this exercise using only a calculator.

| x  | y  | x - \(\bar{x}\) | $\(x - \bar{x})^2\$ | y - \(\bar{y}\) | \((x - \bar{x})(y - \bar{y})\) |
|----|----|----------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 3  | 4  |                |                    |                |                          |
| 2  | 2  |                |                    |                |                          |
| 1  | 3  |                |                    |                |                          |
| -1 | 1  |                |                    |                |                          |
| 0  | 0  |                |                    |                |                          |
| $\sum x_i$ =  | $\sum y_i$ = | \(\sum (x_i - \bar{x})\) = | \(\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2\) = | \(\sum (y_i - \bar{y})\) = | \(\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})\) = |

### a.
Complete the entries in the table. Put the sums in the last row. What are the sample means \(\bar{x}\) and \(\bar{y}\)?

### b.
Calculate \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) using (2.7) and (2.8) and state their interpretation.

### c.
Compute \(\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i^2\), \(\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i y_i\). Using these numerical values, show that \(\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 = \sum x_i^2 - N\bar{x}^2\) and \(\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}) = \sum x_i y_i - N\bar{x}\bar{y}\).

### d.
Use the least squares estimates from part (b) to compute the fitted values of y, and complete the remainder of the table below. Put the sums in the last row.

Calculate the sample variance of y, \(s_y^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}{N - 1}\), the sample variance of x, \(s_x^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{N - 1}\), the sample covariance between x and y, \(s_{xy} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \bar{y})(x_i - \bar{x})}{N - 1}\), the sample correlation between x and y, \(r_{xy} = \frac{s_{xy}}{s_x s_y}\), and the coefficient of variation of x, \(CV_x = 100 \times \frac{s_x}{\bar{x}}\). What is the median, 50th percentile, of x?
