### 2.14 Consider the regression model $WAGE =β_1 +β_2EDUC +e$,where $WAGE$ is hourly wage rate in U.S.  2013 dollars and EDUC is years of education, or schooling. The regression model is estimated twice using the least squares estimator, once using individuals from an urban area, and again for individuals in a rural area


$$ Urban \quad \widehat{WAGE} = -10.76 + 2.46 \cdot EDUC, \quad N = 986 $$
$$ (se) \qquad \quad  (2.27) \qquad (0.16) \qquad$$


$$ Rural \quad \widehat{WAGE} = -4.88 + 1.80 \cdot EDUC, \quad N = 214 $$
$$(se) \qquad \quad  (3.29)  \qquad (0.24) \qquad$$

#### a. Using the estimated rural regression, compute the elasticity of wages with respect to education at the “point of the means.” The sample mean of $WAGE$ is $19.74.
