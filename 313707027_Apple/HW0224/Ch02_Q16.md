###  2.16  The capital asset pricing model $(CAPM)$ is an important model in the field of finance. It explains variations in the rate of return on a security as a function of the rate of return on a portfolio consisting of all publicly traded stocks, which is called the $market$ portfolio. Generally, the rate of return on any investment is measured relative to its opportunity cost, which is the return on a risk-free asset. The resulting difference is called the $risk premium$, since it is the reward or punishment for making a risky investment. The $CAPM$ says that the risk premium on security $j$ is $proportional$ to the risk premium on the market portfolio. That is,
$$ r_j - r_f = \beta_j(r_m-r_f) $$
