### 11.16 Consider the following supply and demand model Demand: 
$$
Q_i = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 P_i + e_{di}, \qquad Supply: Q_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2 P_i + \beta_3 W_i + e_{si}
$$
### where Q is the quantity, P is the price, and W is the wage rate, which is assumed exogenous. Data on these variables are in Table 11.7.

#### a. Derive the algebraic form of the reduced-form equations, $Q = \theta_1 + \theta_2 W + v_2$ and $P = \pi_1 + \pi_2 W + v_1$, expressing the reduced-form parameters in terms of the structural parameters.

#### b. Which structural parameters can you solve for from the results in part (a)? Which equation is “identified”?

There are $M=2$ equations. Identification requires that at least $M-1=1$ variable be omitted from each equation.       
$Q_i = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 P_i + e_{di}$ omitted 1 variable is identified.     
$Q_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2 P_i + \beta_3 W_i + e_{si}$ omitted 0 variable is **NOT** identified.  

#### c. The estimated reduced-form equations are $\hat{Q} = 5 + 0.5W$ and $\hat{P} = 2.4 + 1W$. Solve for the identified structural parameters. This is the method of indirect least squares.

#### d. Obtain the fitted values from the reduced-form equation for P, and apply 2SLS to obtain estimates of the demand equation.
