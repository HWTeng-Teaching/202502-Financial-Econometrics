#### a. Do we have an adequate number of IVs to estimate each equation? Check the necessary condition for the identification of each equation. The necessary condition for identification is that in a system of M equations at least M − 1 variables must be omitted from each equation.

#### b. An equivalent identification condition is that the number of excluded exogenous variables from the equation must be at least as large as the number of included right-hand side endogenous variables. Check that this condition is satisfied for each equation.

#### c. Write down in econometric notation the first-stage equation, the reduced form, for $W_{1t}$, wages of workers earned in the private sector. Call the parameters $\pi_1$, $\pi_2$,…

The first-stage equation:
$$
W_{1t} = \pi_1 + \pi_2 G_t + \pi_3 W_{2t} + \pi_4 TX_{t} + \pi_5 TIME_{t} + \pi_6 P_{t-1} + \pi_7 K_{t-1} + \pi_8 E_{t-1} + \theta
$$

#### d. Describe the two regression steps of 2SLS estimation of the consumption function. This is not a question about a computer software command.

#### e. Does following the steps in part (d) produce regression results that are identical to the 2SLS estimates provided by software specifically designed for 2SLS estimation? In particular, will the t-values be the same?
