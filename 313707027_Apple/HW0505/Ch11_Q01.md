### 11.1 Our aim is to estimate the parameters of the simultaneous equations model
$$
y_1 = \alpha_1 y_2 + e_1
$$
$$
y_2 = \alpha_2 y_1 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + e_2
$$
### We assume that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are exogenous and uncorrelated with the error terms $e_1$ and $e_2$.

---

#### a. Solve the two structural equations for the reduced-form equation for $y_2$, that is, $y_2 = \pi_1 x_1 + \pi_2 x_2 + v_2.$ Express the reduced-form parameters in terms of the structural parameters and the reduced-form error in terms of the **structural parameters** and $e_1$ and $e_2$. Show that $y_2$ is correlated with $e_1$.

#### b. Which equation parameters are consistently estimated using OLS? Explain.

#### c. Which parameters are “identified,” in the simultaneous equations sense? Explain your reasoning.

There are $M=2$ equations. Identification requires that $M-1$ variables be omitted from each equation. Equation (2) is **NOT** identified. Equation (1) is identified because $x_1$ and $x_2$ are omitted. It is possible to estimate $\alpha_1$ consistently. 
 
#### d. To estimate the parameters of the reduced-form equation for $y_2$ using the method of moments (MOM), which was introduced in Section 10.3, the two moment equations are
$$
N^{−1}\sum{x_{i1}(y_2 − \pi_1 x_{i1} − \pi_2 x_{i2})} = 0
$$
$$
N^{−1}\sum{x_{i2}(y_2 − \pi_1 x_{i1} − \pi_2 x_{i2})} = 0
$$
####    Explain why these two moment conditions are a valid basis for obtaining consistent estimators of the reduced-form parameters.

#### e. Are the MOM estimators in part (d) the same as the OLS estimators? Form the sum of squared errors function for $y_2 = \pi_1 x_1 + \pi_2 x_2 + v_2$ and find the first derivatives. Set these to zero and show that they are equivalent to the two equations in part (d).

#### f. Using $\sum{x^2_{i1}} = 1$, $\sum{x^2_{i2}} = 1$,  $\sum{x_{i1}{x_{i2}}} = 0$, $\sum{x_{i1}{y_{1i}}} = 2$, $\sum{x_{i1}{y_{2i}}} = 3$, $\sum{x_{i2}{y_{1i}}} =3$, $\sum{x_{i2}{y_{2i}}} = 4$, and the two moment conditions in part (d) show that the MOM/OLS estimates of $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are $\hat{\pi_1} = 3$ and $\hat{\pi_2} = 4$

#### g. The fitted value $\hat{y_2} = \hat{\pi_1} x_1 + \hat{\pi_2} x_2.$ Explain why we can use the moment condition $\sum{\hat{y_{i2}}(y_{i1}-\alpha_1y_{i2})} = 0$ as a valid basis for consistently estimating $\alpha_1$. Obtain the IV estimate of $\alpha_1$.

#### h. Find the 2SLS estimate of α1 by applying OLS to $y_1 = \alpha_1 \hat{y_2} + e_1^*$. Compare your answer to that in part (g).
