### 8.6 Consider the wage equation
$$
WAGE_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2EDUC_i + \beta_3EXPER_i + \beta_4METRO_i + e_i  \qquad (XR8.6a)
$$

### where wage is measured in dollars per hour, education and experience are in years, and *METRO = 1* if the person lives in a metropolitan area. We have *N = 1000* observations from 2013.

#### a. We are curious whether holding education, experience, and *METRO* constant, there is the same amount of random variation in wages for males and females. Suppose $var(e_i|x_i, FEMALE = 0) = \sigma_M^2$ and $var(e_i|x_i, FEMALE = 1) = \sigma_F^2$. We specifically wish to test the null hypothesis $\sigma_M^2 = \sigma_F^2$ against $\sigma_M^2 \neq \sigma_F^2$ . Using 577 observations on males, we obtain the sum of squared OLS residuals, $SSE_M = 97161.9174$. The regression using data on females yields Ì‚$\hat{\sigma_F} = 12.024$. Test the null hypothesis at the 5% level of significance. Clearly state the value of the test statistic and the rejection region, along with your conclusion.
