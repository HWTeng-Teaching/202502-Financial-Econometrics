### 15.17 The data file *liquor* contains observations on annual expenditure on liquor *(LIQUOR)* and annual income *(INCOME)* (both in thousands of dollars) for 40 randomly selected households for three consecutive years.

#### b. Estimate the model $LIQUOR_{it} = \beta_1 + \beta_2INCOME_{it} + u_i + e_{it}$ using random effects. Construct a 95% interval estimate of the coefficient on $INCOME$. How does it compare to the interval in part (a)?

#### c. Test for the presence of random effects using the LM statistic in equation (15.35). Use the 5% level of significance.

Since p-value is much smaller than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the random effects model is appropriate for this data.

#### d. For each individual, compute the time averages for the variable $INCOME$. Call this variable $INCOMEM$. Estimate the model $LIQUOR_{it} = \beta_1 + \beta_2INCOME_{it} +\gamma INCOMEM_i + c_i + e_{it}$ using the random effects estimator. Test the significance of the coefficient $\gamma$ at the 5% level. Based on this test, what can we conclude about the correlation between the random effect $u_i$ and $INCOME$? Is it OK to use the random effects estimator for the model in (b)?

Since the p-value for $INCOMEM$ is 0.00076987, which is well below the 5% significance level, we reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that INCOME is significantly correlated with the unobserved individual effects, violating the random effects assumption. Therefore, the random effects model is not appropriate, and the fixed effects model should be used instead.
