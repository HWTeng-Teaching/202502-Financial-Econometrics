### 15.17 The data file *liquor* contains observations on annual expenditure on liquor *(LIQUOR)* and annual income *(INCOME)* (both in thousands of dollars) for 40 randomly selected households for three consecutive years.

#### b. Estimate the model $LIQUOR_{it} = \beta_1 + \beta_2INCOME_{it} + u_i + e_{it}$ using random effects. Construct a 95% interval estimate of the coefficient on $INCOME$. How does it compare to the interval in part (a)?

#### c. Test for the presence of random effects using the LM statistic in equation (15.35). Use the 5% level of significance.

#### d. For each individual, compute the time averages for the variable $INCOME$. Call this variable $INCOMEM$. Estimate the model $LIQUOR_{it} = \beta_1 + \beta_2INCOME_{it} +\gammaINCOMEM_i + c_i + e_{it}$ using the random effects estimator. Test the significance of the coefficient $\gamma$ at the 5% level. Based on this test, what can we conclude about the correlation between the random effect $u_i$ and $INCOME$? Is it OK to use the random effects estimator for the model in (b)?
