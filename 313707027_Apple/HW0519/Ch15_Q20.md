### 15.20 This exercise uses data from the STAR experiment introduced to illustrate fixed and random effects for grouped data. In the STAR experiment, children were randomly assigned within schools into three types of classes: small classes with 13–17 students, regular-sized classes with 22–25 students, and regular-sized classes with a full-time teacher aide to assist the teacher. Student scores on achievement tests were recorded as well as some information about the students, teachers, and schools. Data for the kindergarten classes are contained in the data file star.

#### d. Reestimate the model in part (a) with school random effects. Compare the results with those from parts (a) and (b). Are there any variables in the equation that might be correlated with the school effects? Use the LM test for the presence of random effects.

Comparison of Models (a), (b), and (d)
| Method             |  $R^2$     |              Conclusion Summary              |
|--------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| (a) Pooled OLS     | 0.095      | Ignores school heterogeneity, possibly biased|
| (b) Fixed Effects  |   NaN      | Controls for school-level fixed differences  |
| (d) Random Effects |  0.296     | Significant random effects exist             |

Since p-value < 2.2e-16 by LM test, we can reject the null hypothesis that significant random effects exist. Some variables are potentially correlated with school effects, like $SMALL$ may be related to school policy or funding or $FREELUNCH$ may reflect school-level SES differences.

#### e. Using the t-test statistic in equation (15.36) and a 5% significance level, test whether there are any significant differences between the fixed effects and random effects estimates of the coefficients on $SMALL, AIDE, TCHEXPER, WHITE\\_ASIAN$, and $FREELUNCH$. What are the implications of the test outcomes? What happens ifwe apply the test to the fixed and random effects estimates of the coefficient on $BOY$?

The Hausman test yields a p-value of 0.03184, indicating significant differences between the fixed and random effects estimates. This suggests that some explanatory variables may be correlated with unobserved school-specific effects. As a result, the random effects model may produce inconsistent coefficient estimates. We conclude that the fixed effects model is preferred for consistent estimation.

#### f. Create school-averages of the variables and carry out the Mundlak test for correlation between them and the unobserved heterogeneity.

We reject the null hypothesis that the school-level average variables are jointly insignificant. This implies that the regressors are correlated with the unobserved school effects, and therefore, the fixed effects model is more appropriate than the random effects model.
