### 15.6 Using the NLS panel data on $N=716$ young women, we consider only years 1987 and 1988.We are interested in the relationship between $ln(WAGE)$ and experience, its square, and indicator variables for living in the south and union membership. Some estimation results are in Table 15.10.

#### f. Column (5) contains the random effects estimates. Which coefficients, apart from the intercepts, show the most difference from the fixed effects estimates? Use the Hausman test statistic (15.36) to test whether there are significant differences between the random effects estimates and the fixed effects estimates in column (3) (Why that one?). Based on the test results, is random effects estimation in this model appropriate?

The Hausman test statistic is 15.36, which exceeds the 1% critical value (13.28 with df = 4). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that the random effects model is consistent. This indicates that the unobserved individual effects are correlated with the regressors, and the fixed effects model is the appropriate specification.
