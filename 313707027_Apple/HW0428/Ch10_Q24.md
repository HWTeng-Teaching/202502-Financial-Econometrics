### 10.24 Consider the data file *mroz* on working wives. Use the 428 observations on married women who participate in the labor force. In this exercise, we examine the effectiveness of alternative standard errors for the IV estimator. Estimate the model in Example 10.5 using IV/2SLS using both $MOTHEREDUC$ and $FATHEREDUC$ as IV. These will serve as our baseline results.
---

#### a. Calculate the IV/2SLS residuals, $\hat{e_{IV}}$. Plot them versus $EXPER$. Do the residuals exhibit a pattern consistent with homoskedasticity?

From the residual plot, the spread of residuals decreases systematically with EXPER, it suggests heteroskedasticity.

#### b. Regress  $\hat{e_{IV}^2}$ against a constant and $EXPER$. Apply the $NR^2$ test from Chapter 8 to test for the presence of heteroskedasticity.

|       Variable       |    value   |
|:--------------------:|:----------:|
|           n          |     428    | 
|        $R^2$         |   0.01738  |
|        $NR^2$        |  7.438552  |
|       p-value        |   0.006308 |

Since $NR^2 = 7.438552 > 6.63$, we reject the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity at the 1% level. This suggests that heteroskedasticity is present in the model.

#### c. Obtain the IV/2SLS estimates with the software option for Heteroskedasticity Robust Standard Errors. Are the robust standard errors larger or smaller than those for the baseline model? Compute the 95% interval estimate for the coefficient of $EDUC$ using the robust standard error.

The robust standard error for EDUC is slightly larger than the baseline OLS standard error. The 95% C.I. for the coefficient of EDUC using the robust SE is [-0.003947005, 0.126740261], which provides a more reliable inference in the presence of heteroskedasticity.

#### d. Obtain the IV/2SLS estimates with the software option for Bootstrap standard errors, using $B = 200$ bootstrap replications. Are the bootstrap standard errors larger or smaller than those for the baseline model? How do they compare to the heteroskedasticity robust standard errors in (c)? Compute the 95% interval estimate for the coefficient of $EDUC$ using the bootstrap standard error.

The bootstrap standard error for EDUC is 0.03234547. Compared to the baseline model, it is larger, and smaller than the heteroskedasticity-robust SE in part (c). The 95% confidence interval using the bootstrap SE is [0.003650778, 0.128587054 ], which provides another inference method under general conditions.
