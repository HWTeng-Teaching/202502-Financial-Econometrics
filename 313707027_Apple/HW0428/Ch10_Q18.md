### 10.18 Consider the data file *mroz* on working wives. Use the 428 observations on married women who participate in the labor force. In this exercise, we examine the effectiveness of a parentâ€™s college education as an instrumental variable.
---

#### a. Create two new variables. $MOTHERCOLL$ is a dummy variable equaling one if $MOTHEREDUC>12$, zero otherwise. Similarly, $FATHERCOLL$ equals one if $FATHEREDUC>12$ and zero otherwise. What percentage of parents have some college education in this sample?

| Dummy Variable   | Percentage  |
|------------------|:-----------:|
| MOTHERCOLL       | 0.1214953   | 
| FATHERCOLL       | 0.1168224   |
| PARENTSCOLL       | 0.1869159   |

#### b. Find the correlations between $EDUC$, $MOTHERCOLL$, and $FATHERCOLL$. Are the magnitudes of these correlations important? Can you make a logical argument why $MOTHERCOLL$ and $FATHERCOLL$ might be better instruments than $MOTHEREDUC$ and $FATHEREDUC$?

The magnitudes of the correlations are **important**. If $MOTHERCOLL$ and $FATHERCOLL$ are reasonably correlated with $EDUC$, they satisfy the relevance condition for valid instruments.

They may be better instruments than $MOTHEREDUC$ and $FATHEREDUC$ because binary variables like $MOTHERCOLL$ are less likely to be directly related to unobserved factors affecting wage. This makes them more plausibly exogenous and helps meet the exclusion restriction.

#### c. Estimate the wage equation in Example 10.5 using $MOTHERCOLL$ as the instrumental variable. What is the 95% interval estimate for the coefficient of $EDUC$?
The wage equation using $MOTHERCOLL$ as IV:

$$
\hat{ln(WAGE)} = -0.1327561 + 0.0760180EDUC + 0.0433444EXPER - 0.0008711EXPER^2
$$

#### d. For the problem in part (c), estimate the first-stage equation. What is the value of the F-test statistic for the hypothesis that $MOTHERCOLL$ has no effect on $EDUC$? Is $MOTHERCOLL$ a strong instrument?
The first-stage equation: 

$$
\hat{ln(WAGE)} = 12.079094 +2.517068MOTHERCOLL + 0.056230EXPER - 0.001956EXPER^2
$$

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44e85187-b435-44df-b3a3-90e9d76c246c" />

The F-statistic from the first-stage regression is greater than 10, indicating that MOTHERCOLL is a strong instrument for EDUC. This means MOTHERCOLL has a significant effect on EDUC and is **suitable** for use in IV estimation.

#### e. Estimate the wage equation in Example 10.5 using $MOTHERCOLL$ and $FATHERCOLL$ as the instrumental variables. What is the 95% interval estimate for the coefficient of $EDUC$? Is it narrower or wider than the one in part (c)?
The wage equation using $MOTHERCOLL$ and $FATHERCOLL$ as IVs : 

$$
\hat{ln(WAGE)} = -0.2790819 + 0.0878477EDUC + 0.0426761EXPER - 0.0008486EXPER^2
$$

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c925228f-a2e9-4367-88f0-f254b7634a60" />

The 95% C.I. for the EDUC coefficient is (0.02751845, 0.1481769). Compared to part (c), this interval is narrower, which means adding FATHERCOLL has improved precision in estimating the return to education.

#### f. For the problem in part (e), estimate the first-stage equation. Test the joint significance of $MOTHERCOLL$ and $FATHERCOLL$. Do these instruments seem adequately strong?
The first-stage equation: 

$$
\hat{ln(WAGE)} = 11.890259 +1.749947MOTHERCOLL + 2.186612FATHERCOLL + 0.049149EXPER - 0.001449EXPER^2
$$

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16fe5d11-1cc0-4a18-9231-8ca2bd3b0020" />

The joint F-statistic is 56.963 > 10 with a p-value < 0.05. This means MOTHERCOLL and FATHERCOLL are jointly significant predictors of EDUC. Therefore, these instruments appear to be adequately strong.

#### g. For the IV estimation in part (e), test the validity of the surplus instrument. What do you conclude?

<img width="317" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bf40274-5f5b-4470-a15b-b5ef5d024498" />

The p-value of the Sargan test is 0.626, which is greater than 0.05. So we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are valid. This suggests that the extra instrument, FATHERCOLL, is likely valid.
