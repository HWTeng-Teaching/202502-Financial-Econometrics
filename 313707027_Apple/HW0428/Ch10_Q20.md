### 10.20 The CAPM [see Exercises 10.14 and 2.16] says that the risk premium on security j is related to the risk premium on the market portfolio. That is
$$
r_j ‚àí r_ùëì = \alpha_j + \beta_j(r_m ‚àí r_ùëì)
$$
### where $r_j$ and $r_f$ are the returns to security $j$ and the risk-free rate, respectively, $r_m$ is the return on the market portfolio, and $\beta_j$ is the *j*th security‚Äôs ‚Äúbeta‚Äù value. We measure the market portfolio using the Standard & Poor‚Äôs value weighted index, and the risk-free rate by the 30-day LIBOR monthly rate of return. As noted in Exercise 10.14, if the market return is measured with error, then we face an errors-in-variables, or measurement error, problem.

#### a. Use the observations on Microsoft in the data file *capm5* to estimate the CAPM model using OLS. How would you classify the Microsoft stock over this period? Risky or relatively safe, relative to the market portfolio?

$\beta_{msft} = 1.201840 >1$. This suggests that Microsoft is riskier than the market portfolio during this period, as its returns are more sensitive to market changes.

#### b. It has been suggested that it is possible to construct an IV by ranking the values of the explanatory variable and using the rank as the IV, that is, we sort $(r_m ‚àí r_ùëì)$ from smallest to largest, and assign the values $RANK = 1, 2, . . . . , 180$. Does this variable potentially satisfy the conditions IV1‚ÄìIV3? Create $RANK$ and obtain the first-stage regression results. Is the coefficient of $RANK$ very significant? What is the $R^2$ of the first-stage regression? Can $RANK$ be regarded as a strong IV?

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1586ae4c-b54d-40ec-8bb7-9c7072ed4ba3" />

The coefficient on RANK is highly significant (p < 0.001), and the $R^2$ is 0.9126. Therefore, RANK can be regarded as a strong instrument.

#### c. Compute the first-stage residuals, $\hat{v}$ and add them to the CAPM model. Estimate the resulting augmented equation by OLS and test the significance of $\hat{v}$ at the 1% level of significance. Can we conclude that the market return is exogenous?

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2de6c240-952f-4177-9620-fa09af4f75d7" />

The coefficient on $\hat{v}$ is **NOT** statistically significant (p =0.0428), so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that market return is exogenous.

#### d. Use $RANK$ as an IV and estimate the CAPM model by IV/2SLS. Compare this IV estimate to the OLS estimate in part (a). Does the IV estimate agree with your expectations?

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67916f15-1b95-45ae-8bf2-a25318364f47" />

The IV estimate of the market risk premium is 1.278318 > 1.201840 = $\beta_{msft}$. The difference is small, but the IV estimate may be more reliable as it corrects for potential measurement error in the market return.

#### e. Create a new variable $POS = 1$ if the market return $(r_m ‚àí r_ùëì)$ is positive, and zero otherwise. Obtain the first-stage regression results using both $RANK$ and $POS$ as instrumental variables. Test the joint significance of the IV. Can we conclude that we have adequately strong IV? What is the $R^2$ of the first-stage regression?

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd7d4815-8a6c-4539-8ff7-8a59a705cfec" />

The F-statistic from the first-stage regression is 951.3 > 10. Both RANK and POS are jointly significant at the 1% level, and the $R^2$ is 0.9149. This suggests that the instruments are **strong** and explain a good portion of variation in the market return.

#### f. Carry out the Hausman test for endogeneity using the residuals from the first-stage equation in (e). Can we conclude that the market return is exogenous at the 1% level of significance?

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2c7e363-03b2-4c14-a4a5-31b8cbcc2224" />

The coefficient of the first-stage residual $\hat{v}$  is not statistically significant at the 1% level (p = 0.0287), so we do not reject the null hypothesis of exogeneity. This suggests that the market return can be treated as **exogenous**.

#### g. Obtain the IV/2SLS estimates of the CAPM model using $RANK$ and $POS$ as instrumental variables. Compare this IV estimate to the OLS estimate in part (a). Does the IV estimate agree with your expectations?

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcc7985a-271b-4ba5-9de6-e07f9c7e2644" />

The IV estimate of the market risk premium is 1.283118 > 1.201840 = $\beta_{msft}$. This suggests that correcting for potential measurement error or endogeneity actually increases the estimated sensitivity of Microsoft stock to the market. Although the standard error may be larger, the IV estimate still supports that Microsoft is more volatile than the market, on average.

#### h. Obtain the IV/2SLS residuals from part (g) and use them (not an automatic command) to carry out a Sargan test for the validity of the surplus IV at the 5% level of significance.

The p-value from the Sargan test is 0.45488, which is greater than 0.05. So we **cannot** reject the null hypothesis, meaning the surplus instrument POS appears to be valid.
