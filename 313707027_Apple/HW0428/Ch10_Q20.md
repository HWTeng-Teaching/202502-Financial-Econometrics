### 10.20 The CAPM [see Exercises 10.14 and 2.16] says that the risk premium on security j is related to the risk premium on the market portfolio. That is
$$
r_j − r_𝑓 = \alpha_j + \beta_j(r_m − r_𝑓)
$$
### where $r_j$ and $r_f$ are the returns to security $j$ and the risk-free rate, respectively, $r_m$ is the return on the market portfolio, and $\beta_j$ is the *j*th security’s “beta” value. We measure the market portfolio using the Standard & Poor’s value weighted index, and the risk-free rate by the 30-day LIBOR monthly rate of return. As noted in Exercise 10.14, if the market return is measured with error, then we face an errors-in-variables, or measurement error, problem.

#### a. Use the observations on Microsoft in the data file *capm5* to estimate the CAPM model using OLS. How would you classify the Microsoft stock over this period? Risky or relatively safe, relative to the market portfolio?

#### b. It has been suggested that it is possible to construct an IV by ranking the values of the explanatory variable and using the rank as the IV, that is, we sort $(r_m − r_𝑓)$ from smallest to largest, and assign the values $RANK = 1, 2, . . . . , 180$. Does this variable potentially satisfy the conditions IV1–IV3? Create $RANK$ and obtain the first-stage regression results. Is the coefficient of $RANK$ very significant? What is the $R^2$ of the first-stage regression? Can $RANK$ be regarded as a strong IV?

#### c. Compute the first-stage residuals, $\hat{v}$ and add them to the CAPM model. Estimate the resulting augmented equation by OLS and test the significance of $\hat{v}$ at the 1% level of significance. Can we conclude that the market return is exogenous?

#### d. Use $RANK$ as an IV and estimate the CAPM model by IV/2SLS. Compare this IV estimate to the OLS estimate in part (a). Does the IV estimate agree with your expectations?

#### e. Create a new variable $POS = 1$ if the market return $(r_m − r_𝑓)$ is positive, and zero otherwise. Obtain the first-stage regression results using both $RANK$ and $POS$ as instrumental variables. Test the joint significance of the IV. Can we conclude that we have adequately strong IV? What is the $R^2$ of the first-stage regression?

#### f. Carry out the Hausman test for endogeneity using the residuals from the first-stage equation in (e). Can we conclude that the market return is exogenous at the 1% level of significance?

#### g. Obtain the IV/2SLS estimates of the CAPM model using $RANK$ and $POS$ as instrumental variables. Compare this IV estimate to the OLS estimate in part (a). Does the IV estimate agree with your expectations?

#### h. Obtain the IV/2SLS residuals from part (g) and use them (not an automatic command) to carry out a Sargan test for the validity of the surplus IV at the 5% level of significance.
