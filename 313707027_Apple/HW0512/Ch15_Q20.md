### 15.20 This exercise uses data from the STAR experiment introduced to illustrate fixed and random effects for grouped data. In the STAR experiment, children were randomly assigned within schools into three types of classes: small classes with 13–17 students, regular-sized classes with 22–25 students, and regular-sized classes with a full-time teacher aide to assist the teacher. Student scores on achievement tests were recorded as well as some information about the students, teachers, and schools. Data for the kindergarten classes are contained in the data file star.

#### a. Estimate a regression equation (with no fixed or random effects) where *READSCORE* is related to *SMALL, AIDE, TCHEXPER, BOY, WHITE_ASIAN*, and *FREELUNCH*. Discuss the results. Do students perform better in reading when they are in small classes? Does a teacher’s aide improve scores? Do the students of more experienced teachers score higher on reading tests? Does the student’s sex or race make a difference?

The results suggest that students in small classes scored significantly higher on reading tests by approximately 5.82 points, indicating a positive effect of class size reduction. The presence of a teacher aide did not have a statistically significant impact. More experienced teachers were associated with higher student scores. Male students scored significantly lower than female students, and students identified as White or Asian performed better on average. Finally, students eligible for free lunch, a proxy for low socioeconomic status, scored significantly lower, highlighting a persistent achievement gap.

#### b. Reestimate the model in part (a) with school fixed effects. Compare the results with those in part (a). Have any of your conclusions changed? [Hint: specify *SCHID* as the cross-section identifier and *ID* as the “time” identifier.]

$$
\hat{READSCORE_i} = 6.49SMALL_i + 0.99AIDE_i + 0.29TCHEXPER_i - 5.46BOY_i + 8.03WHITE\_ASIAN_i - 14.59FREELUNCH_i

- The fixed effects model controls for unobserved heterogeneity across schools, providing more accurate and unbiased estimates of the explanatory variables.
- While the magnitude of some coefficients slightly changed, the significance and direction of most variables remained consistent across both models.
- Therefore, the positive effect of small classes, the beneficial impact of teacher experience, and the performance gaps by gender, race, and socioeconomic status are all robust to the inclusion of school fixed effects.

#### c. Test for the significance of the school fixed effects. Under what conditions would we expect the inclusion of significant fixed effects to have little influence on the coefficient estimates of the remaining variables?

Since the p-value $<<0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that school fixed effects are statistically significant — meaning that student reading performance systematically differs across schools, even after controlling for class type, teacher experience, and student characteristics.
