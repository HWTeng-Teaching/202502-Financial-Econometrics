### 15.6 Using the NLS panel data on $N=716$ young women, we consider only years 1987 and 1988.We are interested in the relationship between $ln(WAGE)$ and experience, its square, and indicator variables for living in the south and union membership. Some estimation results are in Table 15.10.

#### a. The OLS estimates of the $ln(WAGE)$ model for each of the years 1987 and 1988 are reported in columns (1) and (2). How do the results compare? For these individual year estimations, what are you assuming about the regression parameter values across individuals (heterogeneity)?

The results are quite similar, but some coefficients differ slightly (e.g., UNION drops from 0.1445 to 0.1102), indicating a small change in union wage premium. The coefficient on SOUTH also decreases slightly from −0.2128 to −0.2384 between 1987 and 1988, but this difference is small relative to the standard errors and not statistically significant, suggesting no meaningful change across the two years.

$$
t = \frac{−0.2128 − (−0.2384)}{\sqrt{0.0338^2+0.0344^2}} = \frac{0.0256}{0.0479} \approx 0.534 < 1.96
$$

These estimations assume no unobserved individual heterogeneity, or that such heterogeneity is uncorrelated with the explanatory variables. Essentially, they ignore fixed individual effects.


兩年結果相似，但略有差異，例如 UNION 的係數從 0.1445 下降為 0.1102，顯示工會的薪資溢酬略減。SOUTH 變數的係數在兩年之間略微下降，從 −0.2128 到 −0.2384，但相對標準誤在統計上並不顯著，因此不構成實質上的變化。
這種做法假設不同個體間的異質性（例如能力、教育）都已被控制，或是與誤差項無關；它忽略了個體的固定效果，當作每一位受訪者是一樣的。

#### b. The $ln(WAGE)$ equation specified as a panel data regression model is 

$$
ln(WAGE_{it}) = \beta_1 + \beta_2EXPER_{it} + \beta_3EXPER^2_{it} + \beta_4SOUTH_{it} + \beta_5UNION_{it} +(u_i + e_{it}) \qquad \quad (XR15.6)
$$

#### Explain any differences in assumptions between this model and the models in part (a).

The panel data model includes individual-specific effects $u_i$, accounting for time-invariant unobserved characteristics (e.g., ability, family background). This is the key difference from (a), where such heterogeneity is not accounted for.

模型加入了個體固定項 $u_i$，考慮每位女性可能有不變但影響薪資的特質（如能力、家庭背景等）。這與OLS最大不同點就在於是否控制了這些「看不見的個體差異」。
 
#### c. Column (3) contains the estimated fixed effects model specified in part (b). Compare these estimates with the OLS estimates. Which coefficients, apart from the intercepts, show the most difference?

Comparing column (3) with OLS results, UNION’s coefficient drops substantially from 0.1445 (1987 OLS) to 0.0822, and SOUTH becomes more negative (from −0.2128 to −0.3261). This suggests that accounting for individual effects changes the estimated impact of these variables significantly.

#### d. The F-statistic for the null hypothesis that there are no individual differences, equation (15.20), is 11.68. What are the degrees of freedom of the F-distribution if the null hypothesis (15.19) is true? What is the 1% level of significance critical value for the test? What do you conclude about the null hypothesis.

#### e. Column (4) contains the fixed effects estimates with cluster-robust standard errors. In the context of this sample, explain the different assumptions you are making when you estimate with and without cluster-robust standard errors. Compare the standard errors with those in column (3). Which ones are substantially different? Are the robust ones larger or smaller?
