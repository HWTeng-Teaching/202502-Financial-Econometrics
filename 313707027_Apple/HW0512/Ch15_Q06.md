### 15.6 Using the NLS panel data on $N=716$ young women, we consider only years 1987 and 1988.We are interested in the relationship between $ln(WAGE)$ and experience, its square, and indicator variables for living in the south and union membership. Some estimation results are in Table 15.10.

#### a. The OLS estimates of the $ln(WAGE)$ model for each of the years 1987 and 1988 are reported in columns (1) and (2). How do the results compare? For these individual year estimations, what are you assuming about the regression parameter values across individuals (heterogeneity)?

The results are quite similar, but some coefficients differ slightly (e.g., UNION drops from 0.1445 to 0.1102), indicating a small change in union wage premium. The coefficient on SOUTH also decreases slightly from −0.2128 to −0.2384 between 1987 and 1988, but this difference is small relative to the standard errors and not statistically significant, suggesting no meaningful change across the two years.

$$
t = \frac{−0.2128 − (−0.2384)}{\sqrt{0.0338^2+0.0344^2}} = \frac{0.0256}{0.0479} \approx 0.534 < 1.96
$$

These estimations assume no unobserved individual heterogeneity, or that such heterogeneity is uncorrelated with the explanatory variables. Essentially, they ignore fixed individual effects.

#### b. The $ln(WAGE)$ equation specified as a panel data regression model is 

$$
ln(WAGE_{it}) = \beta_1 + \beta_2EXPER_{it} + \beta_3EXPER^2_{it} + \beta_4SOUTH_{it} + \beta_5UNION_{it} +(u_i + e_{it}) \qquad \quad (XR15.6)
$$

#### Explain any differences in assumptions between this model and the models in part (a).

The panel data model includes individual-specific effects $u_i$, accounting for time-invariant unobserved characteristics (e.g., ability, family background). This is the key difference from (a), where such heterogeneity is not accounted for.

 
#### c. Column (3) contains the estimated fixed effects model specified in part (b). Compare these estimates with the OLS estimates. Which coefficients, apart from the intercepts, show the most difference?

### Comparison of Coefficients: OLS vs. Fixed Effects (Excluding Intercepts)

| Variable   | OLS Average | FE Estimate | Difference (FE − OLS)| Notes                                             |
|------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **EXPER**  | 0.1265      | 0.0575      | **−0.0690**          | Largest difference; OLS likely overestimates      |
| **EXPER²** | −0.0032     | −0.0012     | +0.0020              | Smaller concavity in FE model                     |
| **SOUTH**  | −0.2256     | −0.3261     | −0.1005              | Stronger negative impact in FE                    |
| **UNION**  | 0.1275      | 0.0822      | −0.0453              | Union premium is smaller under FE                 |

Compared to the OLS estimates, the fixed effects model shows the largest change in the coefficient of $EXPER$, dropping from about 0.1265 to 0.0575. This suggests that OLS may have overestimated the return to experience, likely due to omitted variable bias from unobserved individual heterogeneity, which the fixed effects model accounts for.

#### d. The F-statistic for the null hypothesis that there are no individual differences, equation (15.20), is 11.68. What are the degrees of freedom of the F-distribution if the null hypothesis (15.19) is true? What is the 1% level of significance critical value for the test? What do you conclude about the null hypothesis.

$H_0: u_i = 0$      
$H_1: u_i \neq 0$    
$N = 716, \quad T = 2, \quad NT = 1432, \quad k = 5$

The F-statistic of 11.68 tests whether fixed effects are needed. Degrees of freedom:
- Numerator df = N – 1 = 715
- Denominator df = N(T–1) – k = 711     

At the 1% level, the critical value $F_{(715, 711)} = 1.93 < 11.68$, so we reject the null hypothesis. This means fixed effects are necessary.

#### e. Column (4) contains the fixed effects estimates with cluster-robust standard errors. In the context of this sample, explain the different assumptions you are making when you estimate with and without cluster-robust standard errors. Compare the standard errors with those in column (3). Which ones are substantially different? Are the robust ones larger or smaller?

Column (4) uses cluster-robust standard errors to account for within-individual correlation over time. Comparing columns (3) and (4), standard errors for variables like SOUTH increase significantly (from 0.1258 to 0.2495), indicating that standard errors without clustering may underestimate uncertainty.
