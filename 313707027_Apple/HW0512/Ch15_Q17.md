### 15.17 The data file *liquor* contains observations on annual expenditure on liquor *(LIQUOR)* and annual income *(INCOME)* (both in thousands of dollars) for 40 randomly selected households for three consecutive years.
---
#### a. Create the first-differenced observations on *LIQUOR* and *INCOME*. Call these new variables *LIQUORD* and *INCOMED*. Using OLS regress *LIQUORD* on *INCOMED* without a constant term. Construct a 95% interval estimate of the coefficient.

The estimated regression with differenced data is  

$$
\hat{LIQUORD_{it}} =  0.02975INCOMED_{it}
$$

$$
(se) \qquad (0.02922)
$$

The 95% interval estimate of the coefficient of INCOMED is [-0.0284146, 0.0879082]. The 
interval covers zero; we have no evidence against the hypothesis that income does not affect 
liquor expenditures.
