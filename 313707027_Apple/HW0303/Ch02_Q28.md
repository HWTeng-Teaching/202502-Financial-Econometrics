### 2.28 How much does education affect wage rates? The data file $cps5\\_small$ contains 1200 observations on hourly wage rates, education, and other variables from the 2013 Current Population Survey (CPS). [Note: $cps5$ is a larger version.]

#### a. Obtain the summary statistics and histograms for the variables $WAGE$ and $EDUC$. Discuss the data characteristics.

**EDUC:** Based on the summary statistics and histogram, education years are mostly concentrated between 12 and 16 years, which typically corresponds to high school to college education.The distribution of education years is relatively concentrated, meaning most individuals share a similar educational background, with the majority of people being at the high school or college education level.

**WAGE:** We can see that wages are *right-skewed*, meaning most people's wages are concentrated in the lower range, while a few individuals have extremely high wages. This suggests wage inequality or the presence of outliers with very high incomes, which causes the distribution to skew to the right. This right-skewed distribution typically indicates that most individuals are in the low-to-mid wage ranges, and only a few high-income earners are pushing the overall wage level higher.

#### b. Estimate the linear regression $WAGE = \beta_1 + \beta_2EDUC + e$ and discuss the results.
$$
\hat{WAGE} = -10.4000 +2.3968 \times EDUC
$$

#### c. Calculate the least squares residuals and plot them against $EDUC$. Are any patterns evident? If assumptions SR1â€“SR5 hold, should any patterns be evident in the least squares residuals?

#### d. Estimate separate regressions for males, females, blacks, and whites. Compare the results.
$$
\hat{males} = -8.2849 + 2.3785 \times EDUC
$$

$$
\hat{females} = -16.6028 + 2.6595 \times EDUC
$$

$$
\hat{blacks} = -6.2541 + 1.9233 \times EDUC
$$

$$
\hat{whites} = -10.475 + 2.418 \times EDUC
$$

- The coefficient of EDUC represents the effect of education on wages. Females (2.6595) and whites (2.4178) have higher returns to education, while blacks (1.9233) have the lowest return, indicating that each additional year of education results in a smaller wage increase for black individuals.
- Males and females have similar EDUC coefficients, but females have a lower intercept, indicating that at the same education level, females tend to have lower starting wages.
- Whites have a higher EDUC coefficient than blacks, suggesting that for the same level of education, wage growth is higher for whites, possibly reflecting racial wage disparities in the labor market.
#### e. Estimate the quadratic regression $WAGE = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2EDUC^2 + e$ and discuss the results. Estimate the marginal effect of another year of education on wage for a person with 12 years of education and for a person with 16 years of education. Compare these values to the estimated marginal effect of education from the linear regression in part (b).
$$
\hat{WAGE} = 4.916477 + 0.089134 \times EDUC^2
$$

$$
margin \quad effect = \frac{dWAGE}{dEDUC} = 2 \cdot 0.089134 \cdot EDUC
$$

$$
margin \quad effect = \left. \frac{dWAGE}{dEDUC}\right| _{EDUC=12} = 2 \cdot 0.089134 \cdot 12 = 2.139216
$$

$$
margin \quad effect = \left. \frac{dWAGE}{dEDUC}\right| _{EDUC=16} = 2 \cdot 0.089134 \cdot 16 = 2.852288
$$

$$
margin \quad effect(LR)=  \frac{dWAGE}{dEDUC} = \alpha_2 = 2.396761
$$

#### f. Plot the fitted linear model from part (b) and the fitted values from the quadratic model from part (e) in the same graph with the data on $WAGE$ and $EDUC$. Which model appears to fit the data better?
