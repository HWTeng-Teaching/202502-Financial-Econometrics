### 2.25 Consumer expenditure data from 2013 are contained in the file $cex5\\_small$. [Note: $cex5$ is a larger version with more observations and variables.] Data are on three-person households consisting of a husband and wife, plus one other member,with incomes between with incomes between \$1,000 per month to \$20,000 per month. $FOODAWAY$ is past quarterâ€™s food away from home expenditure per month per person, in dollars, and $INCOME$ is household monthly income during past year, in \$100 units.

#### a. Construct a histogram of $FOODAWAY$ and its summary statistics. What are the mean and median values? What are the 25th and 75th percentiles?

#### b. What are the mean and median values of $FOODAWAY$ for households including a member with an advanced degree? With a college degree member? With no advanced or college degree member?
| FOODAWAY |  N  |Mean      |Median|
|----------|:---:|:--------:|:----:|
| Advanced | 257 | 73.15    | 48.15|
| College  | 369 | 48.60    | 36.11|
| None     | 574 | 39.01    | 26.02|

#### c. Construct a histogram of  $ln(FOODAWAY)$ and its summary statistics. Explain why $FOODAWAY$ and $ln(FOODAWAY)$ have different numbers of observations.

In mathematical terms, the logarithmic function cannot be applied to zero or negative values. Therefore, when the values in FOODAWAY are zero or negative, the log function will return NaN or Inf, and these observations will be excluded from the log transformation.

#### d. Estimate the linear regression $ln(FOODAWAY) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 INCOME + e$. Interpret the estimated slope.
$$
\hat{ln(FOODWAY)} = 3.1293 + 0.0069 \times INCOME
$$

#### e. Plot $ln(FOODAWAY)$ against $INCOME$, and include the fitted line from part (d).

#### f. Calculate the least squares residuals from the estimation in part (d). Plot them vs. $INCOME$. Do you find any unusual patterns, or do they seem completely random?
