### 2.25 Consumer expenditure data from 2013 are contained in the file $cex5\\_small$. [Note: $cex5$ is a larger version with more observations and variables.] Data are on three-person households consisting of a husband and wife, plus one other member,with incomes between with incomes between \$1,000 per month to \$20,000 per month. $FOODAWAY$ is past quarterâ€™s food away from home expenditure per month per person, in dollars, and $INCOME$ is household monthly income during past year, in \$100 units.
-----
#### a. Construct a histogram of $FOODAWAY$ and its summary statistics. What are the mean and median values? What are the 25th and 75th percentiles?

#### b. What are the mean and median values of $FOODAWAY$ for households including a member with an advanced degree? With a college degree member? With no advanced or college degree member?

#### c. Construct a histogram of $ln(FOODAWAY)$ and its summary statistics. Explain why $FOODAWAY$ and ln$(FOODAWAY)$ have different numbers of observations.

#### d. Estimate the linear regression ln$(FOODAWAY) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 INCOME + e$. Interpret the estimated slope.

#### e. Plot ln$(FOODAWAY)$ against $INCOME$, and include the fitted line from part (d).

#### f. Calculate the least squares residuals from the estimation in part (d). Plot them vs. $INCOME$. Do you find any unusual patterns, or do they seem completely random?
