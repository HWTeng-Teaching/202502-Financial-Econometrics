### 2.17 The data file $collegetown$ contains observations on 500 single-family houses sold in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, during 2009–2013. The data include sale price (in thousands of dollars), $PRICE$, and total interior area of the house in hundreds of square feet, $SQFT$.
-----
#### a. Plot house price against house size in a scatter diagram.
This scatter plot helps us determine whether house prices increase with house size.    
If the points show an upward trend, it suggests a positive relationship, which may be suitable for further regression modeling.

#### b. Estimate the linear regression model $PRICE = \beta_1 + \beta_2SQFT + e$. Interpret the estimates. Draw a sketch of the fitted line.
$$
\hat{PRICE} = -115.4236 + 13.4029 \times SQFT
$$

Our linear regression model shows a positive relationship between house price (PRICE) and house size (SQFT).    
The red regression line represents the best-fitting prediction relationship.

#### c. Estimate the quadratic regression model $PRICE = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2SQFT^2 + e$. Compute the marginal effect of an additional 100 square feet of living area in a home with 2000 square feet of living space.
$$
\hat{PRICE} = 93.5659 + 0.184519 \times SQFT^2
$$

$$
\left. \frac{dPRICE}{dSQFT}\right| _{SQFT=20} = 2 \cdot 0.184519 \cdot SQFT = 7.38076
$$

Based on the model estimation, when the house size is 2000 square feet, adding 100 square feet of living space will increase the house price by $7.38076(Thousands of Dollars), holding all else constant. This means that as the house size increases, the rate of price increase is affected by the quadratic term. However, when the size is 2000 square feet, the marginal effect of adding 100 square feet is approximately $7,381.    

#### d. Graph the fitted curve for the model in part (c). On the graph, sketch the line that is tangent to the curve for a 2000-square-foot house.
**Fitted Quadratic Curve:** Shows how house prices change as the house size increases. This curve is not just a linear relationship but also considers the non-linear effect of increasing house size on house prices (i.e., the square term of the size).    
**Tangent Line:** Represents the instantaneous rate of change at the point of 2000 square feet, showing how much the house price increases with an additional 100 square feet at that specific point.

#### e. For the model in part (c), compute the elasticity of $PRICE$ with respect to $SQFT$ for a home with 2000 square feet of living space.
Elasticity measures the relative change in the dependent variable due to a relative change in the independent variable. Here, we calculate the **elasticity of house price (PRICE) with respect to house size (SQFT)** using the formula:     

$$
E = \frac{dPRICE}{dSQFT} \times \frac{SQFT}{PRICE}
$$

$$
\frac{dPRICE}{dSQFT} = 2 \cdot \alpha_2 \cdot SQFT
$$

When $SQFT = 2000/100$     

$$
E  = 2 \cdot \alpha_2 \cdot SQFT \times \frac{SQFT}{PRICE} = 0.8819511 \approx 0.882
$$      

If **Elasticity > 1,** house price is elastic to house size, meaning price reacts significantly to changes in size.      
If **Elasticity < 1,** house price is inelastic to house size, meaning price reacts only slightly to changes in size.     
If **Elasticity = 1,** house price has unit elasticity, meaning price changes proportionally to changes in size.

#### f. For the regressions in (b) and (c), compute the least squares residuals and plot them against $SQFT$. Do any of our assumptions appear violated?
The residuals do not show a clear time-series or clustering effect, so the independence assumption is likely satisfied. Since the linear regression residuals show some structure, a higher-order regression model (such as quadratic or other nonlinear models) may be needed. The quadratic regression is clearly a better fit than the linear model, but it may still be insufficient. Additional variables such as location or house age could improve the model.

#### g. One basis for choosing between these two specifications is how well the data are fit by the model. Compare the sum of squared residuals $(SSE)$ from the models in (b) and (c). Which model has a lower $SSE$ ? How does having a lower SSE indicate a “better-fitting” model?

$$SSE = \sum{(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}$$

A smaller $SSE$ means the predicted values $\hat{y}$ are closer to the actual values $y$, indicating a more accurate model. From the results, we observe that 4,222,356 is smaller than 5,262,847, the quadratic regression model has a lower SSE, indicating a better fit to the data compared to the linear regression model.
