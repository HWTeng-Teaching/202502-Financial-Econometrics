### 2.17 The data file $collegetown$ contains observations on 500 single-family houses sold in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, during 2009–2013. The data include sale price (in thousands of dollars), $PRICE$, and total interior area of the house in hundreds of square feet, $SQFT$.
-----
#### a. Plot house price against house size in a scatter diagram.
This scatter plot helps us determine whether house prices increase with house size.    
If the points show an upward trend, it suggests a positive relationship, which may be suitable for further regression modeling.

#### b. Estimate the linear regression model $PRICE = \beta_1 + \beta_2SQFT + e$. Interpret the estimates. Draw a sketch of the fitted line.
Our linear regression model shows a positive relationship between house price (PRICE) and house size (SQFT).    
The red regression line represents the best-fitting prediction relationship.

#### c. Estimate the quadratic regression model $PRICE = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2SQFT^2 + e$. Compute the marginal effect of an additional 100 square feet of living area in a home with 2000 square feet of living space.
Based on the model estimation, when the house size is 2000 square feet, adding 100 square feet of living space will increase the house price by $7.38076(Thousands of Dollars), holding all else constant.    
This means that as the house size increases, the rate of price increase is affected by the quadratic term. However, when the size is 2000 square feet, the marginal effect of adding 100 square feet is $7,380.80.

#### d. Graph the fitted curve for the model in part (c). On the graph, sketch the line that is tangent to the curve for a 2000-square-foot house.

#### e. For the model in part (c), compute the elasticity of $PRICE$ with respect to $SQFT$ for a home with 2000 square feet of living space.

#### f. For the regressions in (b) and (c), compute the least squares residuals and plot them against $SQFT$. Do any of our assumptions appear violated?

#### g. One basis for choosing between these two specifications is how well the data are fit by the model. Compare the sum of squared residuals $(SSE)$ from the models in (b) and (c). Which model has a lower $SSE$ ? How does having a lower SSE indicate a “better-fitting” model?
