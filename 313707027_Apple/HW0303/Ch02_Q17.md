### 2.17 The data file $collegetown$ contains observations on 500 single-family houses sold in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, during 2009–2013. The data include sale price (in thousands of dollars), $PRICE$, and total interior area of the house in hundreds of square feet, $SQFT$.
-----
#### a. Plot house price against house size in a scatter diagram.

#### b. Estimate the linear regression model $PRICE = \beta_1 + \beta_2SQFT + e$. Interpret the estimates. Draw a sketch of the fitted line.

#### c. Estimate the quadratic regression model $PRICE = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2SQFT^2 + e$. Compute the marginal effect of an additional 100 square feet of living area in a home with 2000 square feet of living space.

#### d. Graph the fitted curve for the model in part (c). On the graph, sketch the line that is tangent to the curve for a 2000-square-foot house.

#### e. For the model in part (c), compute the elasticity of $PRICE$ with respect to $SQFT$ for a home with 2000 square feet of living space.

#### f. For the regressions in (b) and (c), compute the least squares residuals and plot them against $SQFT$. Do any of our assumptions appear violated?

#### g. One basis for choosing between these two specifications is how well the data are fit by the model. Compare the sum of squared residuals $(SSE)$ from the models in (b) and (c). Which model has a lower $SSE$ ? How does having a lower SSE indicate a “better-fitting” model?
