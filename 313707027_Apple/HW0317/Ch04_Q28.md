### 4.28 The file *wa-wheat.dat* contains observations on wheat yield inWestern Australian shires. There are 48 annual observations for the years 1950â€“1997. For the Northampton shire, consider the following four equations:

$$
YIELD_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1TIME + e_t
$$
$$
YIELD_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1ln(TIME) + e_t
$$
$$
YIELD_t = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1TIME^2 + e_t
$$
$$
ln(YIELD_t) = \phi_0 + \phi_1TIME + e_t
$$

#### a. Estimate each of the four equations. Taking into consideration (i) plots of the fitted equations, (ii) plots of the residuals, (iii) error normality tests, and (iii) values for $R^2$, which equation do you think is preferable? Explain.

#### b. Interpret the coefficient of the time-related variable in your chosen specification.

#### c. Using your chosen specification, identify any unusual observations, based on the studentized residuals, *LEVERAGE*, *DFBETAS*, and *DFFITS*.

#### d. Using your chosen specification, use the observations up to 1996 to estimate the model. Construct a 95% prediction interval for *YIELD* in 1997. Does your interval contain the true value?
