### 4.28 The file *wa-wheat.dat* contains observations on wheat yield inWestern Australian shires. There are 48 annual observations for the years 1950–1997. For the Northampton shire, consider the following four equations:

$$
YIELD_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1TIME + e_t
YIELDt = α0 + α1 ln(TIME) + et
YIELDt = γ0 + γ1TIME2 + et
ln
(
YIELDt
)
= ϕ0 + ϕ1TIME + et
