### 4.29 Consider a model for household expenditure as a function of household income using the 2013 data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, *cex5_small*. The data file *cex5* contains more observations. Our attention is restricted to three-person households, consisting of a husband, a wife, plus one other. In this exercise, we examine expenditures on a staple item, food. In this extended example, you are asked to compare the linear, log-log, and linear-log specifications.
---
#### a. Calculate summary statistics for the variables: *FOOD* and *INCOME*. Report for each the sample mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. Construct histograms for both variables. Locate the variable mean and median on each histogram. Are the histograms symmetrical and “bell-shaped” curves? Is the sample mean larger than the median, or vice versa? Carry out the Jarque–Bera test for the normality of each variable.

 - Both FOOD and INCOME are right-skewed, suggesting a non-normal distribution.
 - The mean is greater than the median for both FOOD and INCOME, confirming right skewness.
 - The Jarque-Bera test results (p-value < 2.2e-16) strongly reject the null hypothesis of normality for both FOOD and INCOME.
 
#### b. Estimate the linear relationship $FOOD = \beta_1 + \beta_2INCOME + e$. Create a scatter plot *FOOD* versus *INCOME* and include the fitted least squares line. Construct a 95% interval estimate for $\beta_2$. Have we estimated the effect of changing income on average *FOOD* relatively precisely, or not?

#### c. Obtain the least squares residuals from the regression in (b) and plot them against *INCOME*. Do you observe any patterns? Construct a residual histogram and carry out the Jarque–Bera test for normality. Is it more important for the variables *FOOD* and *INCOME* to be normally distributed, or that the random error $e$ be normally distributed? Explain your reasoning.

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af348bba-2cdf-4450-8e75-464e58ad3396" />

The p-value suggests that the residuals are not normally distributed.

#### d. Calculate both a point estimate and a 95% interval estimate of the elasticity of food expenditure with respect to income at *INCOME* = 19, 65, and 160, and the corresponding points on the fitted line, which you may treat as not random. Are the estimated elasticities similar or dissimilar? Do the interval estimates overlap or not? As *INCOME* increases should the income elasticity for food increase or decrease, based on Economics principles?

- The estimated elasticities are not similar, as they increase with income.
- The confidence intervals do not overlap, suggesting significant differences in elasticities across income levels.
- According to Engel's Law, income elasticity for food should decrease as income increases, but the results show an increase, possibly due to changes in food quality or variety at higher income levels.

#### e. For expenditures on food, estimate the log-log relationship $ln(FOOD) = \gamma_1 + \gamma_2ln(INCOME) + e$. Create a scatter plot for *ln(FOOD)* versus *ln(INCOME)* and include the fitted least squares line. Compare this to the plot in (b). Is the relationship more or less well-defined for the log-log model relative to the linear specification? Calculate the generalized $R^2$ for the log-log model and compare it to the $R^2$ from the linear model. Which of the models seems to fit the data better?

Linear-linear model is better than log-log model.

#### f. Construct a point and 95% interval estimate of the elasticity for the log-log model. Is the elasticity of food expenditure from the log-log model similar to that in part (d), or dissimilar? Provide statistical evidence for your claim.

#### g. Obtain the least squares residuals from the log-log model and plot them against *ln(INCOME)*. Do you observe any patterns? Construct a residual histogram and carry out the Jarque–Bera test for normality. What do you conclude about the normality of the regression errors in this model?

The p-value suggests that the residuals are not normally distributed.

#### h. For expenditures on food, estimate the linear-log relationship $FOOD = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2ln(INCOME) + e$. Create a scatter plot for *FOOD* versus *ln(INCOME)* and include the fitted least squares line. Compare this to the plots in (b) and (e). Is this relationship more well-defined compared to the others? Compare the $R^2$ values. Which of the models seems to fit the data better?

|------------------------|:----------:|
| Model 1: Linear-linear | 0.422812   |

 $R^2$: Log-log < Linear-log < Linear-linear. It semms Linear-linear is better to fit the data by $R^2$.
 
#### i. Construct a point and 95% interval estimate of the elasticity for the linear-log model at *INCOME * = 19, 65, and 160, and the corresponding points on the fitted line, which you may treat as not random. Is the elasticity of food expenditure similar to those from the other models, or dissimilar? Provide statistical evidence for your claim.

The p-value suggests that the residuals are not normally distributed.

#### k. Based on this exercise, do you prefer the linear relationship model, or the log-log model or the linear-log model? Explain your reasoning.
The **log-log** model is preferred because the log-log model’s residuals likely suggests a distribution closer to normality compared to the linear and linear-log models.
