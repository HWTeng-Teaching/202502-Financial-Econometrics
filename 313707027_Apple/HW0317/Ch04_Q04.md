### 4.04 The general manager of a large engineering firm wants to know whether the experience of technical artists influences their work quality. A random sample of 50 artists is selected. Using years of work experience (*EXPER*) and a performance rating (*RATING*, on a 100-point scale), two models are estimated by least squares. The estimates and standard errors are as follows:

**Model 1:**

$$
\hat{RATING} = 64.289 + 0.990EXPER  \qquad N = 50 \quad R^2 = 0.3793
$$
$$
(se) \qquad  (2.422) \quad (0.183) \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad
$$


**Model 2:**

$$
\hat{RATING} = 39.464 +15.312ln(EXPER)  \qquad N = 46 \quad R^2 = 0.6414
$$
$$
(se) \qquad (4.198) \quad (1.727) \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad 
$$

#### a. Sketch the fitted values from Model 1 for *EXPER* = 0 to 30 years.

#### b. Sketch the fitted values from Model 2 against *EXPER* = 1 to 30 years. Explain why the four artists with no experience are not used in the estimation of Model 2.

#### c. Using Model 1, compute the marginal effect on *RATING* of another year of experience for (i) an artist with 10 years of experience and (ii) an artist with 20 years of experience.

$
(i) \quad margin \, effect = \left. \frac{\partial RATING}{\partial EXPER}\right| _{EXPER=10} =  0.990
$

$
(ii) \quad margin \, effect = \left. \frac{\partial RATING}{\partial EXPER}\right| _{EXPER=20} =  0.990
$

#### d. Using Model 2, compute the marginal effect on *RATING* of another year of experience for (i) an artist with 10 years of experience and (ii) an artist with 20 years of experience.

$
(i) \quad margin \, effect = \left. \frac{\partial RATING}{\partial EXPER}\right| _{EXPER=10} =  \left. 15.312 \time \frac{1}{EXPER}\right| _{EXPER=10} = 1.5312
$

$
(ii) \quad margin \, effect = \left. \frac{\partial RATING}{\partial EXPER}\right| _{EXPER=10} =  \left. 15.312 \time \frac{1}{EXPER}\right| _{EXPER=20} = 0.7656

#### e. Which of the two models fits the data better? Estimation of Model 1 using just the technical artists with some experience yields $R^2$ = 0.4858.

#### f. Do you find Model 1 or Model 2 more reasonable, or plausible, based on economic reasoning? Explain.
