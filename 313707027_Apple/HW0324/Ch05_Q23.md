### 5.23 The file cocaine contains 56 observations on variables related to sales of cocaine powder in northeastern California over the period 1984–1991. The data are a subset of those used in the study Caulkins, J. P. and R. Padman (1993), *“Quantity Discounts and Quality Premia for Illicit Drugs,”* Journal of the American Statistical Association, 88, 748–757. The variables are 

- $PRICE$ = price per gram in dollars for a cocaine sale
- $QUANT$ = number of grams of cocaine in a given sale
- $QUAL$ = quality of the cocaine expressed as percentage purity
- $TREND$ = a time variable with 1984= 1 up to 1991= 8
### Consider the regression model 
$$
PRICE = \beta_1 + \beta_2 QUANT + \beta_3 QUAL + \beta_4 TREND +e
$$

--- 

#### a. What signs would you expect on the coeﬃcients $\beta_2$, $\beta_3$, and $\beta_4$?

- $\beta_2 < 0$ As the quantity of cocaine sold **increases**, the price per gram typically **decreases** because buyers may receive bulk discounts.
- $\beta_3 > 0$ Higher purity cocaine is expected to be priced **higher** since consumers are usually willing to pay a premium for **better** quality.
- $\beta_4$ is uncertain and could be either **positive or negative**.
  - If stricter drug enforcement reduces supply, prices may increase $(\beta_4 > 0)$.
  - If market competition increases or production efficiency improves, prices may decrease $(\beta_4 < 0)$.

#### b. Use your computer software to estimate the equation. Report the results and interpret the coeﬃcient estimates. Have the signs turned out as you expected?

```
library(POE5Rdata)
data("cocaine")

model <- lm(price ~ quant + qual + trend, data = cocaine)
summary(model)
```

$$
\hat{PRICE} = 90.84669 - 0.05997 QUANT + 0.11621 QUAL - 2.35458 TREND
$$

All the signs align with our expectations.

#### c. What proportion of variation in cocaine price is explained jointly by variation in quantity, quality, and time?

$R^2$ = 0.5097

#### d. It is claimed that the greater the number of sales, the higher the risk of getting caught. Thus, sellers are willing to accept a lower price if they can make sales in larger quantities. Set up $H_0$ and $H_1$ that would be appropriate to test this hypothesis. Carry out the hypothesis test.

```
qt(0.05, df = 54)
```
$H_0 : \beta_2 = 0$.            
$H_1 : \beta_2 < 0$.

$t = -5.892 < t_{(0.05, 54)} = -1.6736$, which **NOT** falls in the rejection region, so we cannot reject $H_0$. 

#### e. Test the hypothesis that the quality of cocaine has no influence on expected price against the alternative that a premium is paid for better-quality cocaine.

```
qt(0.95, df = 54)
```
$H_0 : \beta_3 = 0$.            
$H_1 : \beta_3 > 0$.

$t = -0.572 < t_{(0.95, 54)} = 1.6736$, which **NOT** falls in the rejection region, so we cannot reject $H_0$. 

 
#### f. What is the average annual change in the cocaine price? Can you suggest why price might be changing in this direction?

$\hat{\beta_4}$ = -2.35458 indicates that, on average, the price of cocaine **decreases** by $2.35 per gram per year. This could be due to increased market competition, improvements in supply chain efficiency, or a rise in supply due to reduced enforcement efforts.
