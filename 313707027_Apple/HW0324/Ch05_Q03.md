### 5.3 Consider the following model that relates the percentage of a householdâ€™s budget spent on alcohol *WALC* to total expenditure TOTEXP, age of the household head AGE, and the number of children in the household NK.

$$
WALC = /beta_1 + /beta_2 ln(TOTEXP)+ /beta_3NK + /beta_4AGE +e
$$

### This model was estimated using 1200 observations from London. An incomplete version of this output is provided in Table 5.6.
