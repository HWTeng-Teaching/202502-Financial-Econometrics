### 5.3 Consider the following model that relates the percentage of a household’s budget spent on alcohol *WALC* to total expenditure TOTEXP, age of the household head AGE, and the number of children in the household NK.

$$
WALC = \beta_1 + \beta_2 ln(TOTEXP)+ \beta_3NK + \beta_4AGE +e
$$

### This model was estimated using 1200 observations from London. An incomplete version of this output is provided in Table 5.6.

#### a. Fill in the following blank spaces that appear in this table.
- i. The t-statistic for $b_1$.
- ii. The standard error for $b_2$.
- iii. The estimate $b_3$.
- iv. $R^2$.
- v. $\hat{\sigma}$.

#### b. Interpret each of the estimates $b_2$, $b_3$, and $b_4$.

- $b_2$ = 2.7648： When total household expenditure $(\ln(TOTEXP))$ increases by 1%, the proportion of the budget spent on alcohol **increases** by 2.7648% on average.
- $b_3$ = 0.3695： When the number of children in the household (NK) increases by 1, the proportion of the budget spent on alcohol **increases** by 0.3695% on average. 
- $b_4$ = -0.1503： When the age of the household head (AGE) increases by 1 year, the proportion of the budget spent on alcohol **decreases** by 0.1503% on average.

#### c. Compute a 95% interval estimate for $b_4$. What does this interval tell you?

$95\\% \\, interval = \mu \pm t_{(0.025, 1196)} \times se = -0.1503 \pm 1.96 \times 0.0235 = [-0.1964, -0.1042]$ for $b_4$    

The effect of age on alcohol expenditure falls between -0.1964 and -0.1042. Since the entire interval is negative, it confirms that an increase in age is significantly associated with a decrease in the proportion of the household budget spent on alcohol.

#### d. Are each of the coeﬃcient estimates significant at a 5% level? Why?

|         Variable         | p-value | Significance Decision |
|--------------------------|---------|-----------------------|
| $\beta_1$ (Intercept)    | 0.5099  | Not Significant       |
| $\beta_2$ $(\ln(TOTEXP))$| 0.0000  | Significant           |
| $\beta_3$ (NK)           | 0.0001  | Significant           |
| $\beta_4$ (AGE)          | 0.0000  | Significant           |

At the 5% significance level, the p-values for $b_2$, $b_3$, and $b_4$ are all less than 0.05, indicating that they are statistically significant.

#### e. Test the hypothesis that the addition of an extra child decreases the mean budget share of alcohol by 2 percentage points against the alternative that the decrease is not equal to 2 percentage ponts. Use a 5% significance level.

$H_0: \beta_3 = -0.2$    
$H_1: \beta_3 \neq -0.2$    

$t = \frac{\beta_3-(-0.2)}{SE_3} = \frac{-1.4515+0.2}{0.0939} = 1.475 < t_{(0.025, 1196)} = 1.96$, which **NOT** falls in the rejection region, so we cannot reject $H_0$.
