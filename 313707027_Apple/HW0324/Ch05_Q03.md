### 5.3 Consider the following model that relates the percentage of a household’s budget spent on alcohol *WALC* to total expenditure TOTEXP, age of the household head AGE, and the number of children in the household NK.

$$
WALC = \beta_1 + \beta_2 ln(TOTEXP)+ \beta_3NK + \beta_4AGE +e
$$

### This model was estimated using 1200 observations from London. An incomplete version of this output is provided in Table 5.6.

#### a. Fill in the following blank spaces that appear in this table.
- i. The t-statistic for $b_1$.
- ii. The standard error for $b_2$.
- iii. The estimate $b_3$.
- iv. $R^2$.
- v. $\hat{\sigma}$.

#### b. Interpret each of the estimates $b_2$, $b_3$, and $b_4$.

- $b_2$ = 2.7648：表示當家庭總支出 $(ln(TOTEXP))$ 增加 1%，酒精支出的比例平均增加 2.7648%
- $b_3$ = 0.3695：表示家庭中孩子數量 $(NK)$ 每增加 1 個，酒精支出比例平均增加 0.3695%
- $b_4$ = -0.1503：表示家長年齡 &(AGE)$ 每增加 1 歲，酒精支出比例平均減少 0.1503%

#### c. Compute a 95% interval estimate for β4.What does this interval tell you?

#### d. Are each of the coeﬃcient estimates significant at a 5% level? Why?

#### e. Test the hypothesis that the addition of an extra child decreases the mean budget share of alcohol by 2 percentage points against the alternative that the decrease is not equal to 2 percentage points. Use a 5% significance level.
