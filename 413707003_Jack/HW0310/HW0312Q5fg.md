### **(f)**
$$t_{0.005,49} = 2.6800$$  
$$[1.029 - 2.687 * 0.0957, 1.029 + 2.687 * 0.0957] \approx [0.7719, 1.2861]$$
When BACHELOR increases by 1%, we are 99% confident that INCOME will increase between 771.9 to 1286.1 dollars.

### **(g)**
$$t = \frac{1.029-1}{0.0957} \approx 0.3030$$  
$$t_{0.025,49} \approx 2.009$$  
$$0.3030 < 2.009$$
