# e
# Model 2's R^2 is higher than Model 1's, even when Model 1 is estimated using only the technical artists with some experience, so Model 2 fits the data better.


# f
# Model 2 is more reasonable because it has the property of diminishing marginal returns, where the impact of early experience growth is greater.
