### **(a)**

$\beta_2$ Positive. A higher wage increases the incentive to work.  
$\beta_3$ Positive. More educated women are more likely to work.  
$\beta_4$ Negative. As age increases, it may become difficult to participate in the labor force.  
$\beta_5$ Negative. Having children under the age of six at home makes it more likely that women will stay at home to take care of them.  
$\beta_6$ Negative. Higher non-wife income reduces the necessity for the wife to work.  


### **(b)**

Because WAGE may be correlated with the error term e, this leads to endogeneity.  


### **(c)**

EXPER and EXPER² are strongly correlated with WAGE because more experience usually leads to higher wages.  
EXPER and EXPER² are uncorrelated with the error term e because experience affects HOURS only through WAGE.  


### **(d)**

The number of instrumental variables(2) should be greater than or equal to the number of endogenous variables(1).  
So the model is identified.


### **(e)**

First Stage: Regress WAGE on instrumental variables (EXPER, EXPER²) and all exogenous variables.  
Get the fitted values of WAGE.  
Second Stage: Regress HOURS on the fitted WAGE and the other exogenous variables.  
The resulting coefficients are the IV/2SLS estimates.
