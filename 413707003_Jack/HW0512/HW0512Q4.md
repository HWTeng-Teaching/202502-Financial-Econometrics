### **(a)**

OLS consistency requires that the explanatory variable,  be uncorrelated with the regression error term.  
To show this consider, the first and fourth terms are zero under “contemporaneous” exogeneity.  
However, the second and third terms involve “x” values from one period and random errors “e” from another period.  
Strict form says it error term is uncorrelated with all x.  
So estimator is consistent.
