# 15.6
### **(a)**

The coefficients of EXPER and EXPERÂ² are very similar in both years, while the effects of SOUTH and UNION slightly decrease in 1988.  
When using year-specific OLS, it is implicitly assumed that different individuals share the same regression coefficients and intercept.


### **(b)**

This model allows different individuals to have different intercepts, thereby controlling for unobserved heterogeneity.


### **(c)**

The coefficient of EXPER drops significantly, indicating that OLS overestimated the effect of experience.


### **(d)**

Because F = 11.68 is much greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that fixed effects are significantly present.


### **(e)**

The standard error of SOUTH increases significantly, and UNION also shows an increase.  
The cluster-robust standard errors are larger.
