### **(f)**

The coefficient of EXPER shows the largest difference, increasing from 0.0575 to 0.0986.  

t = (0.0575-0.0986)/((0.033)^2-(0.022)^2)^(1/2)=-1.6710  

Because the Hausman test requires that the FE model be estimated with non-robust standard errors, this ensures that its error structure is consistent with that of the RE model, allowing for a valid comparison.  

Since the coefficient of EXPER increases significantly in the RE model, it suggests that **EXPER** is correlated with the individual-specific effect u_i; therefore, the fixed effects model should be used.
