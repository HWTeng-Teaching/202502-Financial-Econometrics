### **(a)**
12.024^2 = 144.5766  
97161.9174 / (577-4) = 169.5670  
F = 169.5670 / 144.5766 = 1.1729  
F_0.025(573, 419) = 1.19  
F_0.975(573, 419) = 0.84  
Because 1.19 > 1.17 > 0.84, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the error variances in the two genders are equal.

### **(b)**
56231.0382 / (400-5) = 142.3571  
100703.0471 / (600-5) = 169.2488  
F = 169.2488 / 142.3571 = 1.19  
F_0.05(595, 395) = 1.16  
Because 1.19 > 1.16, we reject the null hypothesis that whether marriged or not, the error variances  are equal.
