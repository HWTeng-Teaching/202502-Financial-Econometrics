## **Question(f):**

#### a. Estimate the supply and demand equations that you have formulated in (a) using OLS. Are the signs correct? Are the estimated coefficients significantly different from zero? Compare those results to those in part (b).

1. **Are the OLS signs “correct”?**
   - **Demand equation:** the OLS slope on quantity `q` is positive (+0.15) even though theory (and 2SLS) says it should be negative. → Sign is wrong.
   - **Supply equation:** the OLS slope on `q` is positive—as theory predicts—so the sign is correct here.

2. **Are the OLS coefficients statistically different from zero?**
   - **For demand**, the `q`-slope is not significant (p ≈ 0.76); the intercept is not significant either.  
     Only the shift variables `ps` and `di` pass the 5 % level.
   - **For supply**, all coefficients are highly significant (p < 0.001).

## Why this happens

Quantity and price are determined simultaneously in the market.

- **In the demand equation,** price is the true mover; quantity is endogenous. When you regress price on quantity with OLS, the positive co-movement along the market-equilibrium cloud biases the estimate upward, often beyond zero — the classic simultaneity bias.
- **In the supply equation,** the bias works in the same direction but is weaker because the true slope is already positive; the result is attenuation toward zero rather than a sign reversal.

**Bottom line:** 2SLS (or any valid IV method) is essential for structural estimation in a simultaneous-equations system. OLS can give misleading signs, magnitudes, and significance — especially on the demand side.
