# CH11 Q1
our aim is to estimate the parameters of the simultaneous equations model
$$
y_1  =\α_1 y_2  +e_1
y_2  =\α_2 y_1  +β_1 x_1  +β_2 x_2  +e_2
$$
We assume that x_1 and x_2 are exogenous and uncorrelated with the error terms e_1 and e_2.

## **Question(a):**

#### a. Solve the two structural equations for the reduced-form equation for y_2, that is, y_2  =π_1 x_1  +π_2 x_2  +v_2 . Express the reduced-form parameters in terms of the structural parameters and the reduced-form error in terms of the structural parameters and e_1 and e_2.Show that y_2 is correlated with e_1.
