#### This homework is written by 卓伯呈(313707012)
#### a. Solve the two structural equations for the reduced-form equation for y_2, that is, y_2  =π_1 x_1  +π_2 x_2  +v_2 . Express the reduced-form parameters in terms of the structural parameters and the reduced-form error in terms of the structural parameters and e_1 and e_2.Show that y_2 is correlated with e_1.
