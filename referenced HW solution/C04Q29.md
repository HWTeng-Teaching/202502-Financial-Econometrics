## a. Calculate summary statistics for the variables: FOOD and INCOME. Report for each the sample mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. Construct histograms for both variables. Locate the variable mean and median on each histogram. Are the histograms symmetrical and “bell-shaped” curves? Is the sample mean larger than the median, or vice versa? Carry out the Jarque–Bera test for the normality of each variable.

## b. Estimate the linear relationship FOOD = β1 +β2INCOME +e. Create a scatter plot FOOD versus INCOME and include the fitted least squares line. Construct a 95% interval estimate for β2. Have we estimated the eﬀect of changing income on average FOOD relatively precisely, or not?

## g. Obtain the least squares residuals from the log-log model and plot them against ln(INCOME). Do you observe any patterns? Construct a residual histogram and carry out the Jarque–Bera test for normality. What do you conclude about the normality of the regression errors in this model?

The residuals from the log-log model show no major violations of regression assumptions. The scatter appears random and symmetric, with no obvious patterns and only a slight suggestion of heteroskedasticity. This supports the choice of the log-log model as a statistically well-behaved specification relative to the alternatives.

Jarque–Bera Test for Residuals (Log-Log Model)
The residuals from the log-log model were tested for normality using the Jarque–Bera test. The results are as follows:

Skewness: -0.3577 (slight negative skew)

Kurtosis: 3.0719

Jarque–Bera statistic: 25.85

Degrees of freedom: 2

p-value: 2.436 × 10⁻⁶

The Jarque–Bera statistic (25.85) is significantly greater than the 5% critical value (5.99). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that the residuals from the log-log regression are normally distributed.

## h. For expenditures on food, estimate the linear-log relationship FOOD =α1 +α2ln(INCOME)+e. Create a scatter plot for FOOD versus ln(INCOME) and include the fitted least squares line. Compare this to the plots in (b) and (e). Is this relationship more well-defined compared to the others? Compare the R2 values. Which of the models seems to fit the data better?

The figure is similar to that of the linear model and not as well-defined as the plot for the log-log model. Based on this visual criterion, the log-log model appears to fit the data better.

The R² value for the linear-log model is 0.038, which is lower than that of the linear model and also lower than the generalized R² from the log-log model. Using this statistical criterion, the linear model seems to provide a better fit.
