### C04Q29



*BY 林韋錚 Weizheng Lin (412707009)*

## a. Calculate summary statistics for the variables: FOOD and INCOME. Report for each the sample mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. Construct histograms for both variables. Locate the variable mean and median on each histogram. Are the histograms symmetrical and “bell-shaped” curves? Is the sample mean larger than the median, or vice versa? Carry out the Jarque–Bera test for the normality of each variable.

## b. Estimate the linear relationship FOOD = β1 +β2INCOME +e. Create a scatter plot FOOD versus INCOME and include the fitted least squares line. Construct a 95% interval estimate for β2. Have we estimated the eﬀect of changing income on average FOOD relatively precisely, or not?

## c. Obtain the least squares residuals from the regression in (b) and plot them against INCOME. Do you observe any patterns? Construct a residual histogram and carry out the Jarque–Bera test for normality. Is it more important for the variables FOOD and INCOME to be normally distributed, or that the random error e be normally distributed? Explain your reasoning.

```r
residuals_lm <- resid(lm_model)

ggplot(cex5_small, aes(x = income, y = residuals_lm)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Residuals vs INCOME", x = "INCOME", y = "Residuals")
```

The residuals increase as income increases.

I believe that the random error being normally distributed is more important.


## d. Calculate both a point estimate and a 95% interval estimate of the elasticity of food expenditure with respect to income at INCOME = 19,65, and 160, and the corresponding points on the fitted line, which you may treat as not random. Are the estimated elasticities similar or dissimilar? Do the interval estimates overlap or not? As INCOME increases should the income elasticity for food increase or decrease, based on Economics principles?

```r
beta2 <- coef(lm_model)["income"]
model_summary <- summary(lm_model)
se_beta2 <- model_summary$coefficients["income", "Std. Error"]

income_vals <- c(19, 65, 160)
food_preds <- predict(lm_model, newdata = data.frame(income = income_vals))

elasticity_linear <- beta2 * income_vals / food_preds
se_elasticity_linear <- se_beta2 * income_vals / food_preds

lower_ci_linear <- elasticity_linear - 1.96 * se_elasticity_linear
upper_ci_linear <- elasticity_linear + 1.96 * se_elasticity_linear

elasticity_results_linear <- data.frame(
  INCOME = income_vals,
  Fitted_Point = food_preds,
  Elasticity = elasticity_linear,
  Lower_95_CI = lower_ci_linear,
  Upper_95_CI = upper_ci_linear
)

print(elasticity_results_linear)
```

| INCOME | Fitted_Point | Elasticity  | Lower_95_CI | Upper_95_CI |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 19     | 95.38155    | 0.07145038  | 0.05219387  | 0.09070689  |
| 65     | 111.88114   | 0.20838756  | 0.15222527  | 0.26454986  |
| 160    | 145.95638   | 0.39319883  | 0.28722827  | 0.49916940  |

The estimated elasticities are dissimilar, as the confidence intervals for the three models do not overlap.  
I believe the elasticity initially increases with income but then decreases after reaching a certain income level. At higher income levels, food expenditure no longer increases significantly.

## e. For expenditures on food, estimate the log-log relationship ln(FOOD) = γ1 + γ2ln(INCOME) + e. Create a scatter plot for ln(FOOD) versus ln(INCOME) and include the fitted least squares line.

The generalized R2 is 0.03965 which is slightly smaller than the R2 from the linear model, however, the fitted line is better well-defined than the linear-linear model

## f.	The 95% interval estimate of the elasticity (beta 2) [0.1293432, 0.2432675]

The elasticity of food expenditure from the log-log model is similar and within the range of the linear-linear model. With income = 65, log-log model  has elasticity = 0.18631 while linear-linear is = 0.20838756

## g. Obtain the least squares residuals from the log-log model and plot them against ln(INCOME). Do you observe any patterns? Construct a residual histogram and carry out the Jarque–Bera test for normality. What do you conclude about the normality of the regression errors in this model?

The residuals from the log-log model show no major violations of regression assumptions. The scatter appears random and symmetric, with no obvious patterns and only a slight suggestion of heteroskedasticity. This supports the choice of the log-log model as a statistically well-behaved specification relative to the alternatives.

Jarque–Bera Test for Residuals (Log-Log Model)
The residuals from the log-log model were tested for normality using the Jarque–Bera test. The results are as follows:

Skewness: -0.3577 (slight negative skew)

Kurtosis: 3.0719

Jarque–Bera statistic: 25.85

Degrees of freedom: 2

p-value: 2.436 × 10⁻⁶

The Jarque–Bera statistic (25.85) is significantly greater than the 5% critical value (5.99). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that the residuals from the log-log regression are normally distributed.




## h. For expenditures on food, estimate the linear-log relationship FOOD =α1 +α2ln(INCOME)+e. Create a scatter plot for FOOD versus ln(INCOME) and include the fitted least squares line. Compare this to the plots in (b) and (e). Is this relationship more well-defined compared to the others? Compare the R2 values. Which of the models seems to fit the data better?

The figure is similar to that of the linear model and not as well-defined as the plot for the log-log model. Based on this visual criterion, the log-log model appears to fit the data better.

The R² value for the linear-log model is 0.038, which is lower than that of the linear model and also lower than the generalized R² from the log-log model. Using this statistical criterion, the linear model seems to provide a better fit.

## i. Construct a point and 95% interval estimate of the elasticity for the linear-log model at INCOME = 19, 65, and 160, and the corresponding points on the fitted line, which you may treat as not random. Is the elasticity of food expenditure similar to those from the other models, or dissimilar? Provide statistical evidence for your claim.

The elasticity of income at 65 with CI of linear-log model is similar to log-log model and linear model at income 65.
The elasticity of income at the lowest and highest income level is dissimilar to others.

## k. Based on this exercise, do you prefer the linear relationship model, or the log-log model or the linear-log model? Explain your reasoning.
