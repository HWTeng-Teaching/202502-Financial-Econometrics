### 2.17 The data file $collegetown$ contains observations on 500 single-family houses sold in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, during 2009–2013. The data include sale price (in thousands of dollars), $PRICE$, and total interior area of the house in hundreds of square feet, $SQFT$.
-----
#### a. Plot house price against house size in a scatter diagram.
This scatter plot helps us determine whether house prices increase with house size.    
If the points show an upward trend, it suggests a positive relationship, which may be suitable for further regression modeling.

#### b. Estimate the linear regression model $PRICE = \beta_1 + \beta_2SQFT + e$. Interpret the estimates. Draw a sketch of the fitted line.
$$
\hat{PRICE} = -115.4236 + 13.4029 \times SQFT
$$

We estimate that an additional 100 square feet of living area will increase the expected home price by \$13,402.94 holding all else constant. The estimated intercept −115.4236 would imply that a house with zero square feet has an expected price of /$−115,423.60.

#### c. Estimate the quadratic regression model $PRICE = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2SQFT^2 + e$. Compute the marginal effect of an additional 100 square feet of living area in a home with 2000 square feet of living space.
$$
\hat{PRICE} = 93.5659 + 0.184519 \times SQFT^2
$$

$$
\left. \frac{dPRICE}{dSQFT}\right| _{SQFT=20} = 2 \cdot 0.184519 \cdot SQFT = 7.38076
$$

We estimate that an additional 100 square feet of living area for a 2000 square foot home will increase the expected home price by $7,380.80 holding all else constant.

#### d. Graph the fitted curve for the model in part (c). On the graph, sketch the line that is tangent to the curve for a 2000-square-foot house.
**Fitted Quadratic Curve:** Shows how house prices change as the house size increases. This curve is not just a linear relationship but also considers the non-linear effect of increasing house size on house prices (i.e., the square term of the size).    
**Tangent Line:** Represents the instantaneous rate of change at the point of 2000 square feet, showing how much the house price increases with an additional 100 square feet at that specific point.

#### e. For the model in part (c), compute the elasticity of PRICE with respect to SQFT for a home with 2000 square feet of living space.
$$
\varepsilon = \frac{\partial PRICE}{\partial SQFT} \times \frac{SQFT}{PRICE} = 2 \times 0.184519 \times 20 \div \left( 97,565.9 + 0.184519 \times 20^2 \right)
$$

$$
\approx 0.882
$$

#### f. For the regressions in (b) and (c), compute the least squares residuals and plot them against SQFT.Do any of our assumptions appear violated?

In both models, the residual patterns do not appear random. The variation in the residuals increases as `SQFT` increases, suggesting that the homoskedasticity assumption may be violated.

#### g. One basis for choosing between these two specifications is how well the data are fit by the model. Compare the sum of squared residuals (SSE) from the models in (b) and (c). Which model has a lower SSE? How does having a lower SSE indicate a “better-fitting” model?
$SSE_b$ = 5,262,847

$SSE_c$ = 4,222,356

Since  $SSE_b$ > $SSE_c$ , the quadratic model has a lower SSE. A lower SSE means that the data values are closer to the fitted line for the quadratic model than for the linear model, indicating a better fit.
