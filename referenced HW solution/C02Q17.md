## a.

## b.

## c.

## d.


## e. For the model in part (c), compute the elasticity of PRICE with respect to SQFT for a home with 2000 square feet of living space.
$$
\varepsilon = \frac{\partial PRICE}{\partial SQFT} \times \frac{SQFT}{PRICE} = 2 \times 0.184519 \times 20 \div \left( 97,565.9 + 0.184519 \times 20^2 \right)
$$

$$
\approx 0.1882
$$

## f. For the regressions in (b) and (c), compute the least squares residuals and plot them against SQFT.Do any of our assumptions appear violated?

In both models, the residual patterns do not appear random. The variation in the residuals increases as `SQFT` increases, suggesting that the homoskedasticity assumption may be violated.

## g. One basis for choosing between these two specifications is how well the data are fit by the model. Compare the sum of squared residuals (SSE) from the models in (b) and (c). Which model has a lower SSE? How does having a lower SSE indicate a “better-fitting” model?
$SSE_b$ = 5,262,847

$SSE_c$ = 4,222,356

Since  $SSE_b$ > $SSE_c$ , the quadratic model has a lower SSE. A lower SSE means that the data values are closer to the fitted line for the quadratic model than for the linear model, indicating a better fit.
