## e. For the model in part (c), compute the elasticity of PRICE with respect to SQFT for a home with 2000 square feet of living space.
$$
\varepsilon = \frac{\partial PRICE}{\partial SQFT} \times \frac{SQFT}{PRICE} = 2 \times 0.184519 \times 20 \div \left( 97,565.9 + 0.184519 \times 20^2 \right)
$$

$$
\approx 0.1882
$$

## f. For the regressions in (b) and (c), compute the least squares residuals and plot them against SQFT.Do any of our assumptions appear violated?

## g. One basis for choosing between these two specifications is how well the data are fit by the model. Compare the sum of squared residuals (SSE) from the models in (b) and (c). Which model has a lower SSE? How does having a lower SSE indicate a “better-fitting” model?
