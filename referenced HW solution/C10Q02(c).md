	•	EXPER and EXPER² → WAGE: Under the mechanism of human‑capital accumulation, past labor‑market experience is strongly correlated with the current wage, so the relevance condition is satisfied.
	•	EXPER and EXPER² ↛ e (after controlling for other variables): Because they reflect historical work experience, these variables do not directly affect current hours supplied once the controls are included, so the exogeneity/exclusion condition is met.

Hence, EXPER and EXPER² satisfy both core requirements for valid instruments and can be used for WAGE to correct the bias arising from wage endogeneity.
