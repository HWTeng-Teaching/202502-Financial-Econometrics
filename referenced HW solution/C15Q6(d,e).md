## (d)

df1->N-1=716-1=715  

df2->(1432-716-4)=712 (two year)

alpha=0.01

F_0.99(715,712)=1.19

F=11.68

11.68>1.19->reject H0

therefore,using the FE model is more appropriate because individual difference are significant.
 
## (e)

Cluster standard errors are larger because its controlled the heterogeneity and autocorrelation,
providing more conservative estimates.
