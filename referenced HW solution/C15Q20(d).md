### The comparison between the random-effects model and both OLS and fixed-effects models reveals that most coefficient estimates are quite similar. This indicates that, for most explanatory variables, there is minimal correlation with unobserved school-level heterogeneity.

### Furthermore, the Breusch–Pagan Lagrange Multiplier test (df = 1) yields a highly significant result, leading us to reject the null hypothesis of no random effects. This provides strong evidence of substantial variation in reading scores across schools, thereby justifying the use of a random-effects model over a simple pooled OLS approach.
