### Part (c): Estimate Price Elasticity of Demand at the Means

We begin with the inverse demand function estimated using **Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)** in part (b):

$$
P = \alpha + \lambda_1 Q + \text{controls} + \varepsilon
$$

From this model, the coefficient on quantity, **lambda\_1**, represents the partial derivative of price with respect to quantity:

$$
\lambda_1 = \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}
$$

However, to calculate price elasticity, we need the derivative of **quantity with respect to price**, which is the inverse:

$$
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial P} = \frac{1}{\lambda_1}
$$

---

### Using the Elasticity Formula

Then, using the elasticity formula:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial P} \cdot \frac{\bar{P}}{\bar{Q}} = \frac{1}{\lambda_1} \cdot \frac{\bar{P}}{\bar{Q}}
$$

We plug in the mean price and mean quantity from the dataset, and we get:

$$
\varepsilon \approx -1.27
$$
