# Question 28
## Part a:

The file wa-wheat.dat contains observations on wheat yield in Western Australian shires. There are 48 annual observations for the years 1950–1997. For the Northampton shire, consider the following four equations:

Estimate each of the four equations. Taking into consideration (i) plots of the fitted equations, (ii) plots of the residuals, (iii) error normality tests, and (iii) values for R2, which equation do you think is preferable? Explain.

## Code:

I think that the Quadratic model has the best, because first of all the quadratic model most accurately follows the curvature in the yield data. The log(TIME) and log(YIELD) models underfit or distort the actual yield pattern.

As seen in the model fit below:

As a next step I mapped out the residual data:

Where we see that: 
- The quadratic model’s residuals are the most randomly distributed with minimal structure.
- The log(YIELD) model has residuals that clearly show non-normality and heteroskedasticity.
- Linear and log(TIME) models show some mild patterns, suggesting misspecification.

For R-squared I had the following results: 

 summary(model1)$r.squared
[1] 0.5778369
summary(model2)$r.squared
[1] 0.3385733
summary(model3)$r.squared —> this being the Quadratic model and one which seems to have the highest R²
[1] 0.6890101
summary(model4)$r.squared
[1] 0.5073566

## Part b: Interpret the coefficient of the time-related variable in your chosen specification.

From which we get: Intercept = 0.7737 and TIME coefficient: = 0.0004986

This is means that the wheat yield at TIME = 0, or in this case 1950, is equivalent to 0.7737.  The the TIME coefficient show the exponential growth rate of the wheat yield of 0.0004986. In other words for every increase in T + 1 the wheat yield experiences a corresponding increase of 0.0004986.
