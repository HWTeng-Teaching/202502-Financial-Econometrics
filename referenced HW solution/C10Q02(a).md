# Question (a) : Discuss the signs you expect for each of the coefficients

$\beta_1$ = Zero or positive. Beacuse HOURS can't be negative.<br>
$\beta_2$ = Positive. Because it will be more attractive if the wage is higher.<br>
$\beta_3$ = Positive. Because higher education increases both the willingness and ability to work.<br>
$\beta_4$ = Not sure. As age increases, experience also grows, leading to longer HOURS. However, productivity may decline due to aging.<br>
$\beta_5$ = Negative. Because women may focus on their children rather than working.<br>
$\beta_6$ = Negative. If other family members have sufficient financial resources, women may feel less financial pressure and therefore may not actively participate in the workforce.
