### 10.18.(d) For the problem in part (c), estimate the first-stage equation. What is the value of the F-test statistic for the hypothesis that MOTHERCOLL has no eﬀect on EDUC? Is MOTHERCOLL a strong instrument?
#### code
```r
first_stage <- lm(educ ~ exper + exper2 + MOTHERCOLL, data = mroz_sub)
summary(first_stage)
Anova(first_stage, type = "II")
```

##### From the regression,we can get the first-stage equation for only one instrumental variable:

$\hat{EDUC} = 12.0791 + 0.0562 \cdot EXPER - 0.00196 \cdot EXPER^2 + 2.5171 \cdot MOTHERCOLL$

**Null hypothesis:** $H_0: \beta_{\text{MOTHERCOLL}} = 0$

**Alternative hypothesis:** $H_1: \beta_{\text{MOTHERCOLL}} \neq 0$

The null hypothesis is that the coefficient of MOTHERCOLL is zero.
The value of F test for MOTHERCOLL is 63.5631, which is larger than 10. We fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that MOTHERCOLL has a significant effect on EDUC in the regression model. Thus, MOTHERCOLL is a strong instrumental variable.

### 10.18.(e)Estimate the wage equation in Example 10.5 using MOTHERCOLL and FATHERCOLL as the instrumental variables. What is the 95% interval estimate for the coeﬃcient of EDUC? Is it narrower or wider than the one in part (c)?

#### code
```r
iv_model_2<- ivreg(lwage ~ exper + exper2 + educ |
                          exper + exper2 + MOTHERCOLL + FATHERCOLL,
                        data = mroz_sub)

summary(iv_model_2, diagnostics = TRUE)
confint(iv_model_2, level = 0.95)["educ", ]
```

#### CI
The 95% confidence interval for the two IV model is:CI = [0.027512, 0.14818]

By comparison with two 95% confidence intervals of model ,using two instrumental variable is narrower than the model use only one instrumental variable

|               | 2.5%     | 97.5%    |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| one IV model | -0.00122 | 0.15326  |
| two IV model | 0.027512 | 0.14818  |
