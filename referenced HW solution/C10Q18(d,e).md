### 10.18.(d) For the problem in part (c), estimate the first-stage equation. What is the value of the F-test statistic for the hypothesis that MOTHERCOLL has no eﬀect on EDUC? Is MOTHERCOLL a strong instrument?

The first-stage equation for one IV:
$\hat{EDUC} = 12.0791 + 0.0562 \cdot EXPER - 0.00196 \cdot EXPER^2 + 2.5171 \cdot MOTHERCOLL + \nu$

**Null hypothesis:** $H_0: \beta_{\text{MOTHERCOLL}} = 0$

**Alternative hypothesis:** $H_1: \beta_{\text{MOTHERCOLL}} \neq 0$

The F value for MOTHERCOLL is 63.5631, which is larger than 10. We fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that MOTHERCOLL has a significant effect on EDUC in the regression model. Thus, MOTHERCOLL is a strong instrumental variable.

### 10.18.(e)Estimate the wage equation in Example 10.5 using MOTHERCOLL and FATHERCOLL as the instrumental variables. What is the 95% interval estimate for the coeﬃcient of EDUC? Is it narrower or wider than the one in part (c)?

The 95% confidence interval for the two IV model is:CI = [0.027512, 0.14818]

The 95% confidence interval of model use two instrumental variable is narrower than the model use only one instrumental variable
