### 10.18.(f) For the problem in part (e), estimate the first-stage equation. Test the joint significance of MOTHERCOLL and FATHERCOLL. Do these instruments seem adequately strong?
The first-stage equation:
$\ EDUC = \alpha + \beta_1 \cdot EXPER + \beta_2 \cdot EXPER^2 + \beta_3 \cdot MOTHERCOLL + \beta_4 \cdot FATHERCOLL + \epsilon$.  
The joint significance can be interpreted from the F-statistic 29.15(>10), indicating that at least one of the instruments is strong.  
Also, we see that the F-statistics for MOTHERCOLL and FATHERCOLL are 29.47152 and 43.92736 respectively,   showing that both instruments are valid.

### 10.18.(g)For the IV estimation in part (e), test the validity of the surplus instrument. What do you conclude?
By using the Sargan test for validity, if the null is true, then the statistics $\ NR^2 \sim \chi^2 $, we  see that the test statistic is 0.2346 with the 
corresponding p-value 0.628; hence we do not reject H0 and conclude that both instrument variables are exogenous and valid, also there is no overidentification.
