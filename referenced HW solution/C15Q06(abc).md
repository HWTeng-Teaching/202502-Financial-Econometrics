### (a)

Overall, the coefficient estimates for the years 1987 and 1988 are quite similar, indicating model stability across the two periods. However, estimating the model separately for each year implicitly assumes that there is no unobserved heterogeneity across individuals. In other words, the models do not control for individual-specific fixed characteristics, which may lead to biased estimates.

### (b)

The fixed effects model assumes that each individual has their own fixed effect, representing time-invariant characteristics such as ability, motivation, or family background. Although these characteristics are unobserved, they influence wage outcomes. The fixed effects approach eliminates these unobserved but constant individual differences, thereby avoiding potential endogeneity caused by correlation between individual traits and explanatory variables.

### (c)

In the fixed effects model, the coefficient on `EXPER` drops from around 0.127 (as estimated by OLS) to approximately 0.057, marking the largest decline among the variables. This suggests that failing to control for individual-specific traits (e.g., ability) may lead to an overestimation of the impact of experience on wages.
