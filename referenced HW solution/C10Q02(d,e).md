## d

In our case:

Endogenous variable: 1 (WAGE)

Instruments: 2 (EXPER and EXPER²)

2 instruments ≥ 1 endogenous variable → The equation is overidentified, which is even better — it means we have extra information to test instrument validity.

## e
Step 1 : Regress WAGE on all exogenous variables and the instruments

Step 2 : Substitute WAGE with WAGE^ in the labor supply equation

Step 3 : Estimate this equation via OLS to get the 2SLS estimates
