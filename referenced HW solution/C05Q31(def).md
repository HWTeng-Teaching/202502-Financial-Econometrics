### (d) 

- $H_0: \beta_4 = 3$
- $H_1: \beta_4 \neq 3$

$t = \frac{3.02237-3}{0.6340} =0.0374$

RR={ t: $t_{ (0.05,245) }$ $\le$ -1.651 or $t_{ (0.95,245) }$ $\ge$ 1.651 }

The test statistic's t-value does not fall within the rejection region; therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

**結論：**  The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the expected delay from each train is 3 minutes.

### (e) 

- $H_0: 30 \cdot \beta_2 < 10$
- $H_1: 30 \cdot \beta_2 \geq 10$

估計值： $30 \cdot 0.3681 = 11.04$  
SE： $30 \cdot 0.0351 = 1.053$  

$t = \frac{11.04 - 10}{1.053} = 0.991$  

RR={ t: $t_{ (0.05,245) }$ $\le$ -1.651 or $t_{ (0.95,245) }$ $\ge$ 1.651 }

The test statistic's t-value does not fall within the rejection region; therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

**結論：** 
The data are consistent with the hypothesis that delaying departure time by 30 minutes increases expected travel time by at least 10 minutes.

### (f) 

- $H_0: \beta_4 < 3\beta_3$
- $H_1: \beta_4 \geq 3\beta_3$

$t = \frac{3.0237 - 3x1.5219}{0.8450}=-1.825$

RR={ t: $t_{ (0.05,245) }$ $\le$ -1.651 or $t_{ (0.95,245) }$ $\ge$ 1.651 }

The test statistic's t-value fall within the rejection region; therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.

**結論：** The expected delay from a train is less than three times the delay from a red light.
