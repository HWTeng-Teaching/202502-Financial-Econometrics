We have the t statistic of $\beta_1$ which equals 4.31 and $SE_{\beta_1}=2.672$. Because  
```math
t_{\beta_1}=\frac {\hat{\beta_1}}{SE_{\beta_1}}
```
, we can get the answer $\hat {\beta_1}=4.31*2.672=11.516$

We can use R to draw the linear relationship. We found that the line is increasing, which means the relationship between income and percentage of the population with a bachelor's degree is positive. Besides, the linear model is the first degree equation and the $\hat \beta_2$ is constant, so the estimated line is increasing at a constant rate.
