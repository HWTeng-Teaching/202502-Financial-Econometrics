We have the t statistic of $\beta_1$ which equals 4.31 and $SE_{\beta_1}=2.672$. Because  
```math
t_{\beta_1}=\frac {\hat{\beta_1}}{SE_{\beta_1}}
```
, we can get the answer $\hat {\beta_1}=4.31*2.672=11.516$ 

## (b)

We can use R to draw the linear relationship. We found that the line is increasing, which means the relationship between income and percentage of the population with a bachelor's degree is positive. Besides, the linear model is the first degree equation and the $\hat \beta_2$ is constant, so the estimated line is increasing at a constant rate.

t_beta1 = 10.75  

beta1_hat = 1.029  
 
t_beta1 = beta1_hat / SE(beta1_hat)  

SE(beta1_hat) = beta1_hat / t_beta1  
              = 1.029 / 10.75  
              ≈ 0.0957

H0: alpha = 10   

H1: alpha ≠ 10  

alpha_hat = 11.52  
SE(alpha_hat) = 2.672  

t = (alpha_hat - 10) / SE(alpha_hat)  
  = (11.52 - 10) / 2.672  
  ≈ 0.57
