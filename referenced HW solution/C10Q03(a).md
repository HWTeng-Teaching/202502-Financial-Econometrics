$x = gamma_1 + \theta_1 z + v$ is a simple linear equation, so cov(z, v) should be zero.
To get the coefficient of z (\( \theta_1 \)), we can use the following relation derived from Equation 10.1.3:

$$
\theta_1 = \frac{\text{cov}(z, x)}{\text{var}(z)} - \frac{\text{cov}(z, v)}{\text{var}(z)}
$$

Since cov(z, v) = 0, the expression simplifies to:

$$
\theta_1 = \frac{\text{cov}(z, x)}{\text{var}(z)}
$$
