The equation $x = \gamma_1 + \theta_1 z + v$ is a simple linear regression, so $cov(z, v)$ should be zero.
\nTo get the coefficient of $z$ (denoted as $\theta_1$), we can use the following relation derived from 10.1.3:

$$
\theta_1 = \frac{\text{cov}(z, x)}{\text{var}(z)} - \frac{\text{cov}(z, v)}{\text{var}(z)}
$$

Since $cov(z, v) = 0$, the expression simplifies to:

$$
\theta_1 = \frac{\text{cov}(z, x)}{\text{var}(z)}
$$
