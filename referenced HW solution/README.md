# HW solution

## HW0224

There are three questions. For questions with too many subquestion, I will split it to multiple students.  
Those who are assigned with the same question, edit your subquesitons in the same question. 

For example:
- the assignment "C02Q01(a,b,c,d)" means, Chapter 2, Questions 1 (a) to 1(d). 
- the assignment  "C02Q14(a,b,c)" means, Chapter 2, Question 14, (a) to (c).
