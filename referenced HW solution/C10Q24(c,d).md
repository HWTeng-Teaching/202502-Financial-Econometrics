### 10.24 Consider the data file *mroz* on working wives. Use the 428 observations on married women who participate in the labor force. In this exercise, we examine the effectiveness of alternative standard errors for the IV estimator. Estimate the model in Example 10.5 using IV/2SLS using both $MOTHEREDUC$ and $FATHEREDUC$ as IV. These will serve as our baseline results.

#### c. Obtain the IV/2SLS estimates with the software option for Heteroskedasticity Robust Standard Errors. Are the robust standard errors larger or smaller than those for the baseline model? Compute the 95% interval estimate for the coefficient of $EDUC$ using the robust standard error.

Ans: 


The robust standard errors are larger than the usual IV standard errors.


Using robust standard errors the interval estimate for the coefficient of EDUC is [−0.0041329, 0.1269261]. 

The usual IV estimated standard errors give an interval of [−0.0003945, 0.1231878]

#### d. Obtain the IV/2SLS estimates with the software option for Bootstrap standard errors, using $B = 200$ bootstrap replications. Are the bootstrap standard errors larger or smaller than those for the baseline model? How do they compare to the heteroskedasticity robust standard errors in (c)? Compute the 95% interval estimate for the coefficient of $EDUC$ using the bootstrap standard error.
