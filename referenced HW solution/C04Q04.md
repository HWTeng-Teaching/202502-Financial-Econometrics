 # **ln(0) doesn't exsist, so  experience=0 can't be used**

 
## c. Using Model 1, compute the marginal effect on RATING of another year of experience for (i) an artist with 10 years of experience and (ii) an artist with 20 years of experience
*BY 陳弘偉 Wei*
# **Marginal effect=\frac{d\widehat{RATING}}{dEXPER}=0.990**
# **No matter what value experience is, increase one year of EXPER, rating increase 0.99 point**

(i)

EXPER=10

$$
\frac{d\widehat{RATING}}{dEXPER} = \frac{15.312}{EXPER} = \frac{15.312}{10} = 1.5312
$$

(ii)

EXPER=20

$$
\frac{d\widehat{RATING}}{dEXPER} = \frac{15.312}{EXPER} = \frac{15.312}{20} = 0.7656
$$

## e.

Model 2 fits the data better because its R-squared is 0.6414, higher than Model 1’s R-squared of 0.3793 (or 0.4858 when excluding artists with no experience). This suggests Model 2 explains more variation in the performance ratings.

## f. 
*created by 劉宸宇*

Model 2 is more reasonable based on economic reasoning. It reflects diminishing marginal returns to experience, which aligns with the idea that early years of experience lead to larger improvements, while additional experience has less impact over time. Model 1 assumes a constant marginal effect, which is less realistic.
