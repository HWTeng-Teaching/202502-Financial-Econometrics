## (e) 

| 變數 | OLS 標準誤 | Robust 標準誤 |
|------|------------|----------------|
|intercept|2.36     |2.50            |
| EDUC | 0.14       | 0.16           |
| EXPER| 0.031      | 0.029          |
| METRO| 1.05       | 0.84           |
| FEMALE | 0.81     | 0.80           |


The interval estimates for the intercept and the coefficient of EDUC have gotten wider, and the interval estimates for the others have gotten narrower. 

There is no inconsistency because the robust standard errors might be larger or smaller than the incorrect OLS standard errors.

## (f) 

The addition of the intercept indicator variable MARRIED allows the expected wage, 

conditional on the explanatory variables EDUC, EXPER, METRO and FEMALE to differ between those who are married and those who are not. 

We find no significant difference in the conditional expected wages for those who are married and those who are not. 

In part (b) we were asking about the amount of error variation between the two groups, which we found to be significant. The two issues are quite different.
