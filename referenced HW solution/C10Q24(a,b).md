### 10.24 Consider the data file *mroz* on working wives. Use the 428 observations on married women who participate in the labor force. In this exercise, we examine the effectiveness of alternative standard errors for the IV estimator. Estimate the model in Example 10.5 using IV/2SLS using both $MOTHEREDUC$ and $FATHEREDUC$ as IV. These will serve as our baseline results.
---

#### a. Calculate the IV/2SLS residuals, $\hat{e_{IV}}$. Plot them versus $EXPER$. Do the residuals exhibit a pattern consistent with homoskedasticity?

#### b. Regress  $\hat{e_{IV}^2}$ against a constant and $EXPER$. Apply the $NR^2$ test from Chapter 8 to test for the presence of heteroskedasticity.
