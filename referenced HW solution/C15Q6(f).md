### Use the Hausman test statistic to test whether there are significant differences between the random effects and fixed effects estimates in column (3)?

### Decision and Conclusion (5% Significance Level)

| Variable | t-Statistic | Significance |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| EXPER    | -1.67       | Not significant |
| EXPER²   | -1.29       | Not significant |
| SOUTH    | -0.77       | Not significant |
| UNION    | -1.06       | Not significant |

- At the 5% significance level, none of the coefficient differences between the fixed effects and random effects models are statistically significant.
- **Conclusion: The random effects model is appropriate.**
