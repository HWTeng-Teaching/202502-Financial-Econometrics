##  e. Does following the steps in part (d) produce regression results that are identical to the 2SLS estimates provided by software specifically designed for 2SLS estimation? In particular, will the t-values be the same?

1.The coefficient estimates will be the same because both use two-stage estimation.

2.In hand-calculated 2SLS, we treat hat_x as fixed in the second stage and ignore its estimation error.
  This leads to incorrect standard errors and wrong t-values.
  Software accounts for that first-stage error, so the standard errors and t-values are correct.
