#### d. To estimate the parameters of the reduced-form equation for $y_2$ using the method of moments (MOM), which was introduced in Section 10.3, the two moment equations are
$$
N^{−1}\sum{x_{i1}(y_2 − \pi_1 x_{i1} − \pi_2 x_{i2})} = 0
$$
$$
N^{−1}\sum{x_{i2}(y_2 − \pi_1 x_{i1} − \pi_2 x_{i2})} = 0
$$
#### Explain why these two moment conditions are a valid basis for obtaining consistent estimators of the reduced-form parameters.

The the reduced-form is: 

$$
y_2 = \pi_1 x_1 + \pi_2 x_2 + v_2
$$
$$
v_2 = y_2- \pi_1 x_1 + \pi_2 x_2 
$$

$$
\frac{1}{N} \sum x_{1i} v_{2i} = 0,\quad \frac{1}{N} \sum x_{2i} v_{2i} = 0
$$



#### e. Are the MOM estimators in part (d) the same as the OLS estimators? Form the sum of squared errors function for $y_2 = \pi_1 x_1 + \pi_2 x_2 + v_2$ and find the first derivatives. Set these to zero and show that they are equivalent to the two equations in part (d).
