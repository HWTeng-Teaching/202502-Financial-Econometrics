The first-stage equation:

$$
W_{1t} = \pi_1 + \pi_2 G_t + \pi_3 W_{2t} + \pi_4 TX_{t} + \pi_5 TIME_{t} + \pi_6 P_{t-1} + \pi_7 K_{t-1} + \pi_8 E_{t-1} + \nu_t
$$

- $W_{1t}:$ Wages in the private sector (endogenous variable)
- All variables on the right-hand side are exogenous or predetermined (instruments)
- $\nu_t:$ Error term
