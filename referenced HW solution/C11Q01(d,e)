d. To estimate the parameters of the reduced-form equation for 
y

 using the method of moments (MOM), which was introduced in Section 10.3, the two moment equations are
N

∑

Explain why these two moment conditions are a valid basis for obtaining consistent estimators of the reduced-form parameters.
e. Are the MOM estimators in part (d) the same as the OLS estimators? Form the sum of squared errors function for 
y

 and find the first derivatives. Set these to zero and show that they are equivalent to the two equations in part (d).
