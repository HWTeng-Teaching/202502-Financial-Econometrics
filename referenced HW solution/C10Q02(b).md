# Explain why this supply equation cannot be consistently estimated by OLS regression.



wage could be endogenous because it might be influanced by unobservable factors as for exemple the motivation, ability, job exeprience...that could also affect the hours supply.

the error term may capture these unobservable factors (thus E[eâˆ£WAGES]=0 doesn't hold anymore) and so make the estimators biased and inconsistent.
