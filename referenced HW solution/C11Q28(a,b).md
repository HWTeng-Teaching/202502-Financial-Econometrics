By Demand: $\alpha_{2}P_{i}=Q_{i}-(\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{3}PS_{i}+\alpha_{4}DI_{i}+e_{di})$  

$\Longrightarrow ~ P_{i}=-\dfrac{\alpha_{1}}{\alpha_{2}}+\dfrac{1}{\alpha_{2}}Q_{i}-\dfrac{\alpha_{3}}{\alpha_{2}}PS_{i}-\dfrac{\alpha_{4}}{\alpha_{2}}DI_{i}-\dfrac{1}{\alpha_{2}}e_{di}=\gamma_{1}+\gamma_{2}Q_{i}+\gamma_{3}PS_{i}+\gamma_{4}DI_{i}+u$  

If $\gamma_{2}<0$, law of demand  

$\gamma_{3}>0$, substitate goodss

$\gamma_{4}>0$, truffles are normal goods

By Supply: $\beta_{2}P_{i}=Q_{i}-(\beta_{1}+\beta_{3}PF_{i}+e_{si})$

$\Longrightarrow ~ P_{i}=-\dfrac{\beta_{1}}{\beta_{2}}+\dfrac{1}{\beta_{2}}Q_{i}-\dfrac{\beta_{3}}{\beta_{2}}PF_{i}-\dfrac{1}{\beta_{2}}e_{si}=\delta_{1}+\delta_{2}Q_{i}+\delta_{3}PF_{i}+\delta_{4}DI_{i}+\epsilon $

If $\delta_{2}>0$, supply curve slope $>0$

$\delta_{3}>0$, cost $\uparrow \rightarrow P \uparrow$

Using ivreg() (2SLS) to estimate the demand and supply equations for truffles, the signs of all key variables are consistent with economic theory, including a downward-sloping demand curve, an upward-sloping supply curve, and the expected effects of substitute price, income, and production cost on price.

Moreover, except for the intercept term in the demand equation, all main explanatory variables are statistically significant at the 5% level (and even at the 1% or 0.1% level), indicating strong statistical significance in the model estimates.
