## (d) IV/2SLS Estimation Using `RANK` as an Instrument

In this section, we estimate the CAPM model using two-stage least squares (2SLS), treating the market excess return as a potentially endogenous regressor. The instrument used is `RANK`, which is constructed by ranking the values of the market excess return from smallest to largest.

---

### Step 1: Construct the Instrument `RANK`

```r
# Create the instrumental variable RANK by ranking the market excess returns
# from smallest to largest. Ties are assigned based on order of appearance.
capm$RANK <- rank(capm$excess_mkt, ties.method = "first")
```

---

### Step 2: First-Stage Regression

We regress `excess_mkt` on `RANK` to obtain fitted values.

\[
\text{excess\_mkt}_t = \pi_0 + \pi_1 \cdot \text{RANK}_t + v_t
\]

```r
first_stage <- lm(excess_mkt ~ RANK, data = capm)
summary(first_stage)
```

**Result highlights:**
- \\(R^2 = 0.913\\)
- F-statistic = 1858
- `RANK` is **highly significant** (p < 0.001)  

> This confirms that `RANK` is a **strong instrument**.

---

### Step 3: 2SLS Estimation using `ivreg()`

We estimate the CAPM equation using `RANK` as the instrument for `excess_mkt`.

\[
\text{excess\_msft}_t = \alpha + \beta \cdot \text{excess\_mkt}_t + \varepsilon_t
\]

```r
library(AER)

iv_model <- ivreg(excess_msft ~ excess_mkt | RANK, data = capm)
summary(iv_model)
```

### Estimation Results

| Method       | Beta (Market Coefficient) | Std. Error | t Value | Significance |
|--------------|---------------------------:|-----------:|--------:|--------------|
| **OLS**      | 1.2018                     | 0.1222     | 9.839   | ***          |
| **2SLS**     | 1.2783                     | 0.1280     | 9.986   | ***          |

---

### Conclusion

The 2SLS estimate of \\(\beta\\) is **greater** than the OLS estimate, consistent with theoretical expectations under **measurement error**:

- OLS estimates are biased **toward zero** when regressors are measured with error.
- IV estimation corrects for this attenuation bias.
- The strong performance of the instrument `RANK` ensures reliable identification.

> **Yes**, the IV estimate agrees with expectations. It is consistent, significant, and slightly larger than the OLS estimate, validating the usefulness of `RANK` as an instrument.
