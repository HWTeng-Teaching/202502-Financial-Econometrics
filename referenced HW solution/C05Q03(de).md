**(d)** Are each of the coefficient estimates significant at a 5% level? Why?

- **β₁ (p = 0.5099) :**  Not significant
 
- **β₂, β₃, β₄ (p < 0.05) :**  Statistically significant

Conclusion:

Except for the intercept term 𝛽1, all other coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% significance level

**(e)** Test the hypothesis that the addition of an extra child decreases the mean budget share of alcohol by 2 percentage points against the alternative that the decrease is not equal to 2 percentage points. Use a 5% significance level.   

Test hypothesis:  
- **H₀:** β₃ = –2
  
- **H₁:** β₃ ≠ –2

$$
t = \frac{-1.4547 - (-2)}{0.3695} \approx \frac{0.5453}{0.3695} \approx 1.475
$$

Critical value at 5% significance ≈ ±1.96

**Conclusion:** Fail to reject H₀. There is insufficient evidence to show that β₃ = –2. (There is no evidence to suggest that having an extra child leads to a decline in the alcohol budget share that is different from two percentage points.)
