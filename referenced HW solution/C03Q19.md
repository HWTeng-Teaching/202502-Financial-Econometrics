    First, we plotted the occupancy rates of the motel and its competitor over time. The graph shows that the blue line is generally higher than the red line , meaning that the motel usually has a higher occupancy rate than its competitor. Additionally, both rates tend to follow a similar trend, rising and falling together.

### #The linear regression of MOTEL_PCT and COMP_PCT

 To analyze the relationship between the two occupancy rates, we performed a linear regression. As we can see, the regression equation suggests that for every 1% increase in the competitor’s occupancy rate, the motel’s occupancy rate is expected to increase by 0.8646% on average.

### #The 95% CI of β2

The 95% confidence interval for the regression coefficient β₂ is: [0.4453,1.2840]
Since the coefficient is significant, it suggests that there is a statistically significant positive association between the competitor’s occupancy rate and the motel’s occupancy rate.

## B.The 90% confidence interval of expected MOTEL_PCT

90% Confidence Interval: [77.38,86.47]
    we estimated the motel’s expected occupancy rate when the competitor’s occupancy rate is 70%. The model predicts a value of 81.92%, and we are 90% confident that the true occupancy rate lies between 77.38% and 86.47%.



## c. Hypothesis Testing for β₂
In the linear regression model MOTEL_PCT = β1 +β2COMP_PCT +e, test the null hypothesis H0∶β2 ≤ 0 against the alternative hypothesis H0∶β2 > 0 at the α = 0.01 level of significance. Discuss your conclusion. Clearly define the test statistic used and the rejection region.

## 若p-value < alpha 則可拒絕Ho,B2顯著大於0
## ANS:Reject Ho,B2 is different form zero significantly. Actually,the p-value of B2 is already significant.


## d. 
### In the linear regression model MOTEL_PCT = β1 +β2COMP_PCT +e, test the null hypothesis H0∶β2 = 1 against the alternative hypothesis H0∶β2 ≠ 1 at the α = 0.01 level of significance. If the null hypothesis were true, what would that imply about the motel’s occupancy rate versus their competitor’s occupancy rate? Discuss your conclusion. Clearly define the test statistic used and the rejection region.

### 將樣本統計量計算出來若其絕對值大於critical value(2.831) 則拒絕H0，反之則不拒絕
## ANS : Do not reject H0.不顯著異於1  t-statistic = -0.668  Critical value = 2.831 

## e.
### Calculate the least squares residuals from the regression of MOTEL_PCT on COMP_PCT and plot them against TIME. Are there any unusual features to the plot? What is the predominant sign of the residuals during time periods 17–23 (July, 2004 to January, 2005)?

## ANS: <br>
### For observations 17-23 all the residuals are negative but one.<br>There are several outliers, particularly at periods 2 and 22.<br>The variance of residuals appears to differ between the early and later periods, suggesting possible heteroscedasticity.
