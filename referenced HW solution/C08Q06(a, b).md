(a)Testing variance equality for males vs. females.

Test whether the variation in wages after accounting for education, experience, and location is equal between males and females.

Conclusion:
The variability in wages is significantly different for males and females, even after controlling for education, experience, and metro status. In fact, male residuals are much more spread out.






(b)Testing variance: married vs. single individuals.

Test whether married people—perhaps due to more flexibility or support from a spouse—have more variable wages than single people.

Conclusion:
Although the married group shows slightly more variation, the difference isn’t statistically significant at the 5% level. So, we do not have enough evidence to say married people have more variable wages
