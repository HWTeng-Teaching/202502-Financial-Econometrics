## C11Q17 d. Describe the two regression steps of 2SLS estimation of the consumption function. This is not a question about a computer software command.

$CN_t = \alpha_1 +\alpha_2 (W_{1t}+W_{2t}) + \alpha_3 P_{t} + \alpha_4 P_{t-1} + e_{1t}$
W_{1t}:private sector wages; W_{2t}:public sector wages; P_{t}:nonwage income (profits) in year t; P_{t-1}:nonwage income (profits) in year t-1


Step 1:Obtain the fitted values $\hat{W}_ {1t}$ and $\hat{P}_ t$ (which are endogenous variables in the consumption function) from the estimated reduced-form equations, using all available exogenous and predetermined variables as instruments.
$\hat{W}_ {1t}=\pi_1 +\pi_2 G_{t} + \pi_3 W_{2t} + \pi_4 TX_{t} + \pi_5 P_{t-1} + \pi_6 K_{t-1} + \pi_7 E_{t-1} + \pi_8 TIME_{t} +\nu $
$\hat{P}_ {t}=\theta_1 +\theta_2 G_{t} + \theta_3 W_{2t} + \theta_4 TX_{t} + \theta_5 P_{t-1} + \theta_6 K_{t-1} + \theta_7 E_{t-1} + \theta_8 TIME_{t} +\nu $
Then, create $W_t^* = \hat{W}_ {1t} + W_{2t}$


Step 2: Regress $CN_t$ on $W_t^*$, $\hat{P}_ t$, $P_{t-1}$, and constant by OLS.
