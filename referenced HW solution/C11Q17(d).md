$CN_t = \alpha_1 +\alpha_2 (W_{1t}+W_{2t}) + \alpha_3 P_{t} + \alpha_4 P_{t-1} + e_{1t}$

Step 1:Obtain the fitted values $\hat{W}_ {1t}$ and $\hat{P}_ t$ (which are endogenous variables in the consumption function) from the estimated reduced-form equations, using all available exogenous and predetermined variables as instruments. Then, create $W_t^* = \hat{W}_ {1t} + W_{2t}$


Step 2: Regress $CN_t$ on $W_t^*$, $\hat{P}_ t$, $P_{t-1}$, and constant by OLS.
