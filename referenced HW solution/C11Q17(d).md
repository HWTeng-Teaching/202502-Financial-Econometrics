Step 1:Obtain fitted values $\hat{W}_{1t}$, $\hat{P}_t$ (endogenous variable in the consumption function) from the estimated reduced form equations using all exogenous variables.Then, create $W_t^* = \hat{W}_{1t} + \hat{W}_{2t}$

Step 2: Regress $CN_t$ on $W_t^*$, $\hat{P}_t$, $P_{t-1}$, and constant by OLS.
