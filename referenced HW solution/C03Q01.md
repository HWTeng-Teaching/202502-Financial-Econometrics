## C03Q01 (Olympic Medals and GDP)
There were 64 countries in 1992 that competed in the Olympics and won at least one medal. Let **MEDALS** be the total number of medals won, and let **GDPB** be GDP (billions of 1995 dollars). A linear regression model explaining the number of medals won is:  

\[
MEDALS = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \cdot GDPB + e
\]  

The estimated relationship is:  

\[
\widehat{MEDALS} = 7.61733 + 0.01309 \cdot GDPB
\]  

\[
(se) = (2.38994) \quad (0.00215)
\]

## a. Hypothesis Testing 

*By 陳亮妘 English Name*
We wish to test the hypothesis that there is no relationship between the number of medals won and GDP against the alternative that there is a positive relationship.  

## Null and Alternative Hypotheses: 

Null Hypothesis : H0 : β₂ = 0 (No relationship between GDP and the number of medals)  
Alternative Hypothesis : H1 : β₂ > 0 (Positive relationship between GDP and the number of medals)  


## b. Test Statistic and Distribution

*By 陳亮妘 English Name*


The test statistic for the hypothesis is:  

t = ( b₂ - β₂ ) / SE(β₂) = b₂ / SE(β₂) ~ t(62)


## c. 
### 當對立假設是True時，β₂>0，且t統計量分布會往右移


## d. 
### 查表在99%顯著水準下t(62)=2.388  當t大於或等於2.388則拒絕虛無假設，反之，t小於2.388則無法拒絕H0


## e.
### t=(0.01309-0)/0.00215=6.088>2.388，故拒絕h0   有證據支持gdp和得牌數為正相關
