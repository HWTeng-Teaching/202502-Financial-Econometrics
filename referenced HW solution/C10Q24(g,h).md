## (g) IV/2SLS Estimation Using `RANK` and 'POS' as an Instrument Variable

Similar to part (d), we add `POS` as another instrument variable. 
Note that we have already constructed `POS` part (e), which equals 1 if market eccess return is positive.
Our two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression model would treat the market excess return as a potentially endogenous regressor, 
the instrument used is `RANK` and `POS`.

```R
library(AER)

iv_model <- ivreg(y ~ mkt_excess | RANK + POS, data = capm5)
summary(iv_model)
```
The regression result are as follows

The beta estimated from OLS was 1.2018, and here we have the estimated beta 1.2831.

In conclusion, the IV estimate is agree with our expectation that 'RANK` and `POS` explained some part of the variation that the OLS don't.
Which lead into a slightly higher coefficient(beta)

## (h) Sargan Test of the IV/2SLS in part (g)

We first obtain the residual of the IV/2SLS in part (g), then Perform a regression of the residuals obtained in the previous step,
using all instrumental variables (`RANK` and `POS`) as explanatory variables to test whether the instruments can explain the residuals.
Finally, we conduct the $NR^2$ test to simulate the Sargan Test.

```R
v_hat <- residuals(iv_model)

sargan_aux <- lm(v_hat ~ RANK + POS, data = capm5)
summary(sargan_aux)

n <- nobs(sargan_aux)                      
R2 <- summary(sargan_aux)$r.squared       
J_stat <- n * R2

df <- 2 - 1  
p_value <- pchisq(J_stat, df = df, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

The Results are as follows

The p-value is 0.45488, which is smaller than 0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis supporting the validity of the instrument variables.
