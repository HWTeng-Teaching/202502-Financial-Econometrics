### 2.25 Consumer expenditure data from 2013 are contained in the fle cer5_small. [Note: cex5 is a lage
version with more observations and variables.) Data are on three-person households consisting of a
husband and wife, plus one other member, with incomes between $1000 per month to S20,000 per
month. FOODAWAY' is past quarter's food away from home expenditure per month per per person, in
dollars, and INCOME is household monthly income during past year, in S100 units.

This is the histogram of food away. You can see that the data is mostly concentrated on the left side, showing a right-skewed pattern.

From the summary, we can see that, the first percentile is ’12.04’, the third percentile is ’67.5’, and the mean is ’49.27’, the median is ’49.27’

#### b. What are the mean and median values of FOODAWAY for households including a member with an advanced degree? With a college degree member? With no advanced or college degree member?

We can see that when a member has an advanced degree, the mean is ‘73.2’ and the median is ‘48.2’. When a member has a college degree, the mean is ‘48.6’ and the median is ‘36.1’. However, when no member has either degree, the mean is ‘39’ and median is ‘26’.

#### c. Construct a histogram of ln(FOODAWAY) and its summary statistics. Explain why FOODAWAY and ln(FOODAWAY) have different numbers of observations.

There are 1200 observations for FOODAWAY, but only 1022 finite observations for ln(FOODAWAY). This discrepancy occurs because 178 households reported zero expenditures for FOODAWAY. Taking the natural logarithm of zero results in negative infinity (-Inf) in R. These -Inf values are not considered valid for further statistical analysis, reducing the number of usable observations in ln(FOODAWAY).

#### d. Estimate the linear regression ln(FOODAWAY) = beta_{1}+beta_{2}INCOME+e. Interpret the estimated slpoe.
