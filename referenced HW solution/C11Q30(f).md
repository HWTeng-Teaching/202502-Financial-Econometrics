## (f) Sargan Test Explanation 

1. **Hypotheses**  
   - $H_0$: All instruments are exogenous (uncorrelated with the error term) ⇒ instruments are valid.  
   - $H_1$: At least one instrument is endogenous (correlated with the error) ⇒ instruments are invalid.

2. **Test Statistic**  
   
   $J = n \times R^2$
     
   where \(n\) is the number of observations used in the 2SLS, and $R^2$ is the R-squared from regressing the 2SLS residuals on all instruments.

3. **Critical Value**  
   Degrees of freedom \(df = L - B = 5 - 1 = 4\)  
   
   $\chi^2_{4,\,0.95} \approx 9.488$
   

4. **Decision Rule**  
   - If $J > 9.488$, reject \(H_0\): evidence that at least one instrument is invalid.  
   - If $J \le 9.488$, do not reject \(H_0\): no evidence against validity, instruments are considered valid.

Because 18.4439 > 9.488, we reject H0 and conclude at least one instrument is invalid.
