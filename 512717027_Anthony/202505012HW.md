## 📊 C11Q28 – Truffle Market Equilibrium Analysis (A–F)

This analysis estimates the supply and demand system for truffles using 2SLS and OLS, computes elasticity, plots curves, and evaluates market equilibrium.

### (a) Rewriting Demand and Supply Equations (P on LHS)

**Demand Equation**
```
Q = α_1 + α_2 P + α_3 PS + α_4 DI + e_d
P = δ_1 + δ_2 Q + δ_3 PS + δ_4 DI + u_d
```
Expected signs:
- δ_2 < 0 (law of demand)
- δ_3 > 0 (substitute price effect)
- δ_4 > 0 (normal good income effect)

**Supply Equation**
```
Q = β_1 + β_2 P + β_3 PF + e_s
P = φ_1 + φ_2 Q + φ_3 PF + u_s
```
Expected signs:
- φ_2 > 0 (positive supply slope)
- φ_3 > 0 (cost-push price effect)

### (b) 2SLS Estimation of Demand and Supply

```r
library(AER)

# Load data
data("truffles")  # Replace with read.csv("truffles.csv") if needed

# 2SLS estimation
iv_demand <- ivreg(P ~ Q + PS + DI | PS + DI + PF, data = truffles)
iv_supply <- ivreg(P ~ Q + PF | PF + PS + DI, data = truffles)

summary(iv_demand)
summary(iv_supply)
```

> ✅ Coefficient signs match theory and are statistically significant.

---

### (c) Price Elasticity of Demand at Means

Elasticity formula:
```math
\varepsilon_D = \frac{1}{\delta_2} \cdot \frac{\bar{P}}{\bar{Q}}
```

```r
mean_P <- 62.724
mean_Q <- 18.458
delta2 <- -2.6705
elasticity <- (1 / delta2) * (mean_P / mean_Q)  # Result: -1.2725
```

> Demand is elastic at the sample mean (|\( \varepsilon_D \)| > 1).

---

### (d) Plotting Supply and Demand Curves

```r
# Set exogenous variables: DI = 3.5, PS = 22, PF = 23
curve_demand <- function(Q) 111.5801 - 2.6705 * Q
curve_supply <- function(Q) 9.2470 + 2.9367 * Q

curve(curve_demand, from = 10, to = 25, col = "blue", ylab = "Price", xlab = "Quantity")
curve(curve_supply, from = 10, to = 25, col = "red", add = TRUE)
legend("topright", legend = c("Demand", "Supply"), col = c("blue", "red"), lty = 1)
```

---

### (e) Solving for Market Equilibrium

```r
# Solve: 111.5801 - 2.6705*Q = 9.2470 + 2.9367*Q
Q_eq <- (111.5801 - 9.2470) / (2.9367 + 2.6705)  # 18.2503
P_eq <- 111.5801 - 2.6705 * Q_eq  # 62.8427

# Reduced form estimates:
Q_rf <- 7.8951 + 0.6564 * 22 + 2.1672 * 3.5 - 0.5070 * 23  # 18.2604
P_rf <- -32.5124 + 1.7081 * 22 + 7.6025 * 3.5 + 1.3539 * 23  # 62.8154
```

> Results agree closely between structural and reduced-form models.

### (f) Comparing OLS and 2SLS Estimates

```r
ols_demand <- lm(P ~ Q + PS + DI, data = truffles)
ols_supply <- lm(P ~ Q + PF, data = truffles)

summary(ols_demand)
summary(ols_supply)
```

| Method | Model   | Q Coefficient | Interpretation                     |
|--------|---------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| OLS    | Demand  | Positive ❌     | Endogeneity bias, violates theory  |
| 2SLS   | Demand  | Negative ✅     | Corrected, matches economic logic  |
| Both   | Supply  | Positive ✅     | Consistent and significant         |

> 2SLS corrects for endogeneity and yields valid results.

## 📉 C11Q30 – Klein’s Model I: Investment Equation Analysis

### (a) OLS Estimation of Investment Function

```r
ols_invest <- lm(I ~ P + PLAG + KLAG, data = klein)
summary(ols_invest)
```

- P, PLAG: Positive, significant → profits drive investment
- KLAG: Negative, significant → large capital base deters further investment

---

### (b) Reduced-Form Estimation and F Test

```r
reduced_P <- lm(P ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5 + PLAG + KLAG, data = klein)
summary(reduced_P)
# Use car::linearHypothesis() for joint F-test
```

- F = 1.93 < 3.03 → fail to reject H0 → extra variables not significant

---

### (c) Hausman Test for Endogeneity

```r
klein$vh <- resid(reduced_P)
hausman_test <- lm(I ~ P + PLAG + KLAG + vh, data = klein)
summary(hausman_test)
```

- Residual (vh) is significant → **P is endogenous**

---

### (d) 2SLS Estimation

```r
iv_invest <- ivreg(I ~ P + PLAG + KLAG | X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5 + PLAG + KLAG, data = klein)
summary(iv_invest)
```

- P becomes insignificant
- PLAG becomes more significant
- KLAG remains significant and negative

---

### (e) Second-Stage OLS with Fitted Profits

```r
klein$P_hat <- fitted(reduced_P)
second_stage <- lm(I ~ P_hat + PLAG + KLAG, data = klein)
summary(second_stage)
```

- Coefficients similar, but **standard errors are incorrect**
- Correct inference requires robust SEs

---

### (f) Sargan Test for Instrument Validity

```r
# TR^2 = n * R^2 from regression of 2SLS residuals on instruments
r2 <- summary(lm(resid(iv_invest) ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5, data = klein))$r.squared
TR2 <- 21 * r2  # 1.815
qchisq(0.95, df = 4)  # 9.4877
```

- TR² = 1.815 < 9.4877 → fail to reject null → instruments are valid ✅
