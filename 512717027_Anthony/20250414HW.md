a
Test whether the error variances are equal for males and females Data:

Male sample size (nM = 577), dfM = 577 − 4 = 573
SSEM = 97161.9174
Female estimate: σ̂F = 12.024 → σ̂²F = 144.5766
Hypotheses:

H₀: σ̂²M = σ̂²F
H₁: σ̂²M ≠ σ̂²F
Estimate variance for males:

σ̂²M = 97161.9174 / 573 ≈ 169.567

Test statistic:

GQ = 169.567 / 144.5766 ≈ 1.173

Critical values:

F573,419,0.025 = 0.8377
F573,419,0.975 = 1.1968
Conclusion:
Since 0.8377 < 1.173 < 1.1968, we fail to reject H₀.
→ No sufficient evidence to indicate that error variances differ between genders.

b
Test whether the error variances differ between married and single individuals

Model:
WAGEi = β₁ + β₂ EDUi + β₃ EXPERi + β₄ METROi + β₅ FEMALEi + ei

Data:

Single: n = 400, df = 395, SSE = 56231.0382
Married: n = 600, df = 595, SSE = 100703.0471
Hypotheses:

H₀: σ²MARRIED = σ²SINGLE
H₁: σ²MARRIED > σ²SINGLE
Calculate variances:

σ²SINGLE = 56231.0382 / 395 ≈ 142.357
σ²MARRIED = 100703.0471 / 595 ≈ 169.248
Test statistic:

GQ = 169.248 / 142.357 ≈ 1.1889

Critical value (one-tailed):
F0.95,595,395 ≈ 1.1647

Conclusion:
1.1889 > 1.1647 → reject H₀
→ Married individuals have significantly greater error variance.

c
NR² Test for Heteroskedasticity

Hypotheses:

H₀: α₂ = α₃ = α₄ = α₅ = 0 (Homoskedasticity)
H₁: Not all αi = 0 (Heteroskedasticity)
Test statistic:
NR² = 59.03
χ²0.95,4 = 9.49

Conclusion:
59.03 > 9.49 → reject H₀
→ Heteroskedasticity exists in the model.

This aligns with result in (b), confirming variance difference between marital statuses.

d
White Test

Variables:

Original: EDUC, EXPER, METRO, FEMALE (4 variables)
Squared terms: Only EDUC² and EXPER² are valid (METRO² = METRO; FEMALE² = FEMALE)
Cross-product terms (6):
EDUC×EXPER
EDUC×METRO
EDUC×FEMALE
EXPER×METRO
EXPER×FEMALE
METRO×FEMALE
Total degrees of freedom:

4 (original) + 2 (squares) + 6 (cross terms) = 12

Test statistic:
NR² = 78.82
χ²0.95,12 = 21.026

Conclusion:
78.82 > 21.026 → reject H₀
→ Confirms heteroskedasticity exists in the model

Consistent with parts (b) and (c).

e
Comparison of OLS vs Robust Standard Errors
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1662e64-6012-4909-a317-5d24dd947ebd)
Conclusion:

EDUC: robust SE > OLS SE → confidence interval widens
Others: robust SE < OLS SE → confidence interval narrows
Varying degrees of heteroskedasticity affect SE differently
f
Is the t-value ≈ 1 for MARRIED inconsistent with (b)?

Context:

df = 1000 − 6 = 994, α = 0.05 → critical value = ±1.96
|t| = 1.0 < 1.96 → not significant at 5%
Interpretation:

Coefficient of MARRIED is not significant for wage (when controlling for other variables)
Clarification:

(b): tests for error variance difference
(f): tests whether MARRIED significantly explains wage
Conclusion:

No contradiction.
MARRIED may not significantly affect wages directly,
but its error variance can still be higher → reasonable.

a
OLS Regression and Confidence Interval Estimation

Regression Result (Focus on KIDS variable):

Estimated Coefficient (β̂₄): -81.826
Standard Error (SE): 27.130
t test = 1.97214
95% Confidence Interval: [ [-135.3298, -28.32302] ]
Conclusion:

Controlling for INCOME and AGE, each additional child is associated with a reduction of approximately 81.826 miles in annual travel distance. This estimate is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, as the confidence interval does not include 0.

b
Graphical Check for Heteroskedasticity: Residual Plots

1. Residuals vs INCOME
2. Residuals vs AGE
Observations:

Residuals vs INCOME:
Residuals show greater variation and a funnel-like pattern at higher income levels, suggesting possible heteroskedasticity.

Residuals vs AGE:
Residuals are relatively evenly spread but include some outliers.

Conclusion:

The plot indicates a widening variation of residuals with income, suggesting potential heteroskedasticity in the regression model. This pattern is not obvious with AGE, implying the issue is related to INCOME rather than AGE.

c
Goldfeld–Quandt Test for Heteroskedasticity

Test Steps:

Sort the sample by INCOME
Split into the lowest 90 and highest 90 observations
Perform OLS for each group and compute SSE
Compute F-statistic:
Results Summary:

Item	Value
SSE (Low income group)	101744.65
SSE (High income group)	315821.55
F statistic	3.104
Critical Value (α = 0.05, df₁ = 86, df₂ = 86)	1.4286
Hypotheses:

H₀: σ²₁ = σ²₂ (Equal variance)
H₁: σ²₂ > σ²₁ (Heteroskedasticity, higher variance in high-income group)
Conclusion:

Since ( F = 3.104 > 1.4286 ), reject H₀.
At the 5% significance level, we have sufficient evidence to suggest heteroskedasticity exists in the model.

d
Re-estimation Using White Robust Standard Errors

Model Result (KIDS):

Estimate (β̂₄): -81.826
Robust Standard Error (HC1): 29.154
95% Confidence Interval: [ [-138.969, -24.684] ]
Comparison:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3bd87e9-8334-4e57-b077-407d3bb8bfaa)

Interpretation:

GLS estimate is slightly smaller than OLS due to weighting (1/INCOME²)
GLS SE is smaller → more efficient inference
Confidence intervals are narrower in GLS and Robust GLS, indicating more precise estimates

Goldfeld–Quandt Test: Testing Error Variance Equality between Males and Females

Hypotheses:

H₀: σ²_M = σ²_F (Homoskedasticity)
H₁: σ²_M ≠ σ²_F (Heteroskedasticity)
Calculation Results:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f156787-d85b-41dc-b2b3-d0d8c06ab9cd)

Conclusion:
F = 1.0538 lies within the non-rejection region (0.9453 < 1.0538 < 1.0581).
→ Fail to reject H₀.
No evidence of different error variances between males and females at the 5% significance level.

b
NR² Test: Testing for Heteroskedasticity Related to Specific Variables

Variables: METRO, FEMALE, BLACK

Hypotheses:

H₀: Errors are not related to these variables (homoskedasticity)
H₁: Errors are related to at least one of them (heteroskedasticity)
Test Results:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42b4e800-10c1-4b82-b3c7-8c0d33701bd6)
Conclusion:
Since NR² = 23.5568 > 11.3449 → Reject H₀.
Errors are significantly related to METRO, FEMALE, or BLACK → Evidence of heteroskedasticity.

c
White Test for General Heteroskedasticity

Hypotheses:

H₀: Constant error variance (homoskedasticity)
H₁: Non-constant error variance (heteroskedasticity)
Test Results:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72e2e51f-33b6-432f-bd89-e8f3a36d7714)
Conclusion:
p < 0.01 → Reject H₀.
Model exhibits clear heteroskedasticity. Recommend using robust SE or FGLS.

d
Comparison: OLS vs White Robust Standard Errors
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06200f62-a8ed-4168-aec7-2f172feeb1ea)
Conclusion:
Robust SE corrects for heteroskedasticity.
Increases or decreases are modest but improve inference reliability.

e
Steps:

Recommendation:
FGLS + Robust SE is preferred due to its robustness and efficiency, especially in presence of heteroskedasticity as indicated by tests in parts (b) and (c).
