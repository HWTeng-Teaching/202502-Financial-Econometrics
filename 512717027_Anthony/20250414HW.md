(a)Testing variance equality for males vs. females
Test whether the variation in wages after accounting for education, experience, and location is equal between males and females. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adba1ac5-5f39-467f-9926-51bacc844fbb)
Conclusion:
The variability in wages is significantly different for males and females, even after controlling for education, experience, and metro status. In fact, male residuals are much more spread out.


(b)Testing variance: married vs. single individuals
Test whether married people—perhaps due to more flexibility or support from a spouse—have more variable wages than single people. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/850412bf-b97e-4fe7-a421-db10a1bd5d96)
Conclusion:
Although the married group shows slightly more variation, the difference isn’t statistically significant at the 5% level. So, we do not have enough evidence to say married people have more variable wages

(e) Comparing usual vs. robust standard errors
The regression from part (b) provides both regular OLS standard errors and robust (White) standard errors:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01fb0d77-3cd4-4a7f-a74b-69c6279ee25c)
Conclusion: The presence of heteroskedasticity affects the precision of the estimates differently. 
Some estimates become less precise (wider intervals), others more precise. This is not inconsistent, but rather a typical result when robust SEs correct for unequal variance.

(f) Interpretation of t-value for MARRIED
When the variable MARRIED is added to the regression, its t-value is about 1.0, using heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors.
This suggests MARRIED is not a statistically significant predictor of average wage.
However, the result from part (b) was about variance in wages, not mean differences.
Conclusion: This is not a contradiction. 
The MARRIED variable may not significantly affect the mean wage but could still be associated with differences in error variance (heteroskedasticity), which was supported by the tests in (c) and (d).

(a) OLS estimation and 95% confidence interval for KIDS
Regression Result (Focus on KIDS variable):

Estimated Coefficient (β̂₄): -81.826
Standard Error (SE): 27.130
t test = 1.97214
95% Confidence Interval: [ [-135.3298, -28.32302] ]
Conclusion:

Controlling for INCOME and AGE, each additional child is associated with a reduction of approximately 81.826 miles in annual travel distance. 
This estimate is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, as the confidence interval does not include 0.

(b) Residual plots and heteroskedasticity
Graphical Check for Heteroskedasticity: Residual Plots

1. Residuals vs INCOME
2. Residuals vs AGE
Observations:

Residuals vs INCOME:
Residuals show greater variation and a funnel-like pattern at higher income levels, suggesting possible heteroskedasticity.

Residuals vs AGE:
Residuals are relatively evenly spread but include some outliers.

Conclusion:
The plot indicates a widening variation of residuals with income, suggesting potential heteroskedasticity in the regression model. 
This pattern is not obvious with AGE, implying the issue is related to INCOME rather than AGE.

(c) Goldfeld–Quandt test for heteroskedasticity
Goldfeld–Quandt Test for Heteroskedasticity
Test Steps:
1.Sort the sample by INCOME
2.Split into the lowest 90 and highest 90 observations
3.Perform OLS for each group and compute SSE
4.Compute F-statistic:
Results Summary:


Hypotheses:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d658e27-1467-42af-81bf-8baf0bf9f763)
H₀: σ²₁ = σ²₂ (Equal variance)
H₁: σ²₂ > σ²₁ (Heteroskedasticity, higher variance in high-income group)
Conclusion:

Since ( F = 3.104 > 1.4286 ), reject H₀.
At the 5% significance level, we have sufficient evidence to suggest heteroskedasticity exists in the model.

(d) Heteroskedasticity-robust OLS estimation
Re-estimation Using White Robust Standard Errors

Model Result (KIDS):

Estimate (β̂₄): -81.826
Robust Standard Error (HC1): 29.154
95% Confidence Interval: [ [-138.969, -24.684] ]
Comparison:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/908613a5-bba0-4754-a877-5cd64b120fe3)

Conclusion:
1.Same estimate: Model is unchanged
2.Larger SE: Robust SE accounts for heteroskedasticity
3.Wider CI: Reflects more conservative and accurate inference

(e) GLS estimation assuming specific form of heteroskedasticity
GLS and Robust GLS Estimation: Assuming Var(eᵢ) = σ²·INCOMEᵢ²
Apply Generalized Least Squares (GLS) and Robust SE (HC1) for improved inference.
KIDS Variable Results:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c3ea47d-8161-4072-8cee-00b5d5d0bf0a)
Interpretation:
1.GLS estimate is slightly smaller than OLS due to weighting (1/INCOME²)
2.GLS SE is smaller → more efficient inference
3.Confidence intervals are narrower in GLS and Robust GLS, indicating more precise estimates
