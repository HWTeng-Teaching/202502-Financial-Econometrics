## 📘 C15Q06 – Panel Data Analysis with NLS Young Women Sample

This question uses panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of 716 young women in 1987 and 1988. The key variables include:

- `lnWAGE`: log of hourly wage  
- `EXPER`: years of work experience  
- `EXPER2`: squared experience  
- `SOUTH`: 1 if residing in the South, 0 otherwise  
- `UNION`: 1 if union member, 0 otherwise

### (a) OLS by Year – Assumption of No Heterogeneity

OLS regressions are run separately for 1987 and 1988:

> These models assume the same intercept and slope for all individuals in each year. That is, no individual heterogeneity: \( u_i = 0 \).

### (b) Panel Random Effects (RE) Model

The RE model allows for an individual-specific random intercept \( u_i \), capturing unobserved heterogeneity. Slopes are constant across individuals.

- \( u_i \): time-invariant individual effects (e.g., innate ability, region)
- \( e_{it} \): idiosyncratic error

> Compared to OLS, RE estimates (e.g., \( \hat{\beta}_2 = 0.0986 \), SE = 0.0220) show smaller coefficients and lower standard errors → higher efficiency.

### (c) Fixed Effects (FE) vs OLS – Which Coefficient Differs Most?

95% CI under FE model:

| Variable  | 95% CI (FE)              | OLS Estimate in CI? | Interpretation              |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| `EXPER`   | (-0.0085, 0.1235)         | ❌ No                | Statistically significant   |
| `EXPER2`  | (-0.0034, 0.0010)         | ✅ Yes               | Not significantly different |
| `SOUTH`   | (-0.5777, -0.0745)        | ✅ Yes               | Not significantly different |
| `UNION`   | (0.0198, 0.1446)          | ✅ Yes               | Not significantly different |

> `EXPER` shows a statistically significant difference between OLS and FE → prefer FE.

### (d) F Test for Fixed Effects

- df₁ = N − 1 = 715  
- df₂ = NT − N − K = 712

- F = 11.68 > critical value ≈ 1.19

✅ Reject \( H_0 \): no individual fixed effects.

> Use Fixed Effects model to account for unobserved heterogeneity.

---

### (e) Cluster-Robust Standard Errors in FE

Even if \( e_{it} \) are uncorrelated, \( \tilde{e}_{it} \) from within transformation are serially correlated.

| Variable  | SE Ratio (Traditional / Cluster-Robust) | Interpretation              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `EXPER`   | 1.0061                                   | Robust and stable           |
| `EXPER2`  | 1.0000                                   | Identical                   |
| `SOUTH`   | 0.5042                                   | Robust SE ≈ 2× larger       |
| `UNION`   | 0.8501                                   | Robust SE ≈ 1.18× larger    |

> Use cluster-robust SE to avoid underestimated standard errors when serial correlation or heteroskedasticity exists.

### (f) Hausman Test: RE vs FE

| Variable  | RE / FE Ratio | t-stat | Significant? | Notes                       |
|-----------|---------------|--------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| `EXPER`   | 1.71          | -1.67  | 10%          | Suggests endogeneity        |
| `EXPER2`  | 1.92          | 1.29   | No           |                             |
| `SOUTH`   | 0.71          | -0.77  | No           |                             |
| `UNION`   | 1.25          | -1.06  | No           |                             |

- Only `EXPER` shows significant difference → prefer FE
- Stata disallows Hausman test with robust SE → use classic standard errors

> Overall, RE is mostly supported but FE preferred for `EXPER` due to potential endogeneity.
