## (a) Goldfeld–Quandt Test for Gender-based Variance Equality

We estimate the wage model separately for males and females, excluding the FEMALE dummy since it's constant within subgroups.

### Model:

$$
\log(WAGE) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 EDUC + \beta_3 EXPER + \beta_4 EXPER^2 + \beta_5 BLACK + \beta_6 METRO + \beta_7 SOUTH + \beta_8 MIDWEST + \beta_9 WEST + e
$$

### Estimation Results:

* SSE (male) = 1195.5430 with df = 5415
* SSE (female) = 917.3754 with df = 4366

$$
GQ = \frac{917.3754 / 4366}{1195.5430 / 5415} = 0.9517
$$

Critical values at 5% level:

* $F_{0.025, 5415, 4366} = 0.9451$
* $F_{0.975, 5415, 4366} = 1.0579$

Since $0.9517 \in [0.9451, 1.0579]$, we **fail to reject** $H_0$: variances are equal.

> **Conclusion**: No significant difference in error variance between males and females.

## (b) Breusch–Pagan NR^2 Test

We regress squared residuals from OLS on METRO, FEMALE, and BLACK.

$$
R^2 = 0.0024 \Rightarrow NR^2 = 23.56
$$

* Degrees of freedom = 3
* $\chi^2_{0.99, 3} = 11.3449$

Since 23.56 > 11.34, we **reject** $H_0$. Error variance depends on METRO, FEMALE, and BLACK.

---

## (c) White Test for Heteroskedasticity

Auxiliary regression includes all variables, squares, and interactions (45 variables).

$$
R^2 = 0.0172 \Rightarrow NR^2 = 168.53
$$

* df = 45
* $\chi^2_{0.95, 45} = 61.66$

Since 168.53 > 61.66, we **reject** $H_0$. Strong evidence of heteroskedasticity.

## (d) OLS vs Robust Standard Errors

Using HC1 correction:

| Variable  | OLS 95% CI            | Robust 95% CI         |
| --------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Intercept | \[1.138, 1.264]       | \[1.137, 1.266]       |
| educ      | \[0.0978, 0.1047]     | \[0.0975, 0.1050]     |
| exper     | \[0.0271, 0.0322]     | \[0.0270, 0.0322]     |
| exper^2   | \[–0.00050, –0.00039] | \[–0.00050, –0.00039] |
| female    | \[–0.1842, –0.1468]   | \[–0.1841, –0.1469]   |
| black     | \[–0.1447, –0.0783]   | \[–0.1431, –0.0800]   |
| metro     | \[0.0949, 0.1431]     | \[0.0963, 0.1417]     |
| south     | \[–0.0723, –0.0192]   | \[–0.0730, –0.0185]   |
| midwest   | \[–0.0916, –0.0363]   | \[–0.0908, –0.0370]   |
| west      | \[–0.0348, 0.0216]    | \[–0.0351, 0.0219]    |

> Conclusion: Robust intervals are slightly wider/narrower depending on variable but results remain statistically consistent.

## (e) FGLS Estimation using METRO and EXPER

Estimate variance function from residuals:

$$
\ln(\hat{e}_i^2) = -3.156 + 0.2372 METRO + 0.00499 EXPER
$$

Compute weights $w_i = 1 / \hat{h}_i$ for FGLS.

Result: Estimates similar to OLS, standard errors marginally smaller for BLACK, METRO, SOUTH.

---

## (f) FGLS with Robust SE (CR2)

Using same weights as (e), but with robust SE:

| Model                 | 95% CI for FEMALE   |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| OLS + robust SE (d)   | \[–0.1841, –0.1469] |
| FGLS + default SE (e) | \[–0.1848, –0.1476] |
| FGLS + robust SE (f)  | \[–0.1863, –0.1442] |

> Robust FGLS intervals are slightly narrower, indicating improved efficiency.

---

## (g) Which Estimates to Report?

Recommend: **OLS with robust SE** from part (d).

**Reasons**:

* Tests in (b), (c) confirm heteroskedasticity
* Robust SE provides valid inference under heteroskedasticity
* Easy to interpret and implement
* FGLS gains are minimal in this case

> **Conclusion**: Report OLS + robust SE for practical and statistically reliable results.
