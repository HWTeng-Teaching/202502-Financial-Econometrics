We consider the following simultaneous equations model:

(1)  y₁ = α₁ y₂ + ε₁  
(2)  y₂ = α₂ y₁ + β₁ x₁ + β₂ x₂ + ε₂  

where x₁ and x₂ are exogenous variables (uncorrelated with both ε₁ and ε₂).

### a 

From equation (1):
  y₁ = α₁ y₂ + ε₁
⇒ y₂ = (y₁ - ε₁) / α₁

Substitute into equation (2):

y₂ = α₂ y₁ + β₁ x₁ + β₂ x₂ + ε₂  
    = α₂ (α₁ y₂ + ε₁) + β₁ x₁ + β₂ x₂ + ε₂  
⇒ y₂ (1 - α₁ α₂) = α₂ ε₁ + β₁ x₁ + β₂ x₂ + ε₂  
⇒ y₂ = [β₁ x₁ + β₂ x₂ + α₂ ε₁ + ε₂] / (1 - α₁ α₂)

This is the reduced-form equation for y₂:

y₂ = π₁ x₁ + π₂ x₂ + v₂

where:

π₁ = β₁ / (1 - α₁ α₂)

π₂ = β₂ / (1 - α₁ α₂)

v₂ = (α₂ ε₁ + ε₂) / (1 - α₁ α₂)

Since v₂ includes ε₁, which is correlated with y₂, y₂ is endogenous.


### b

In equation (1): y₁ = α₁ y₂ + ε₁
 → y₂ is endogenous ⇒ OLS cannot consistently estimate α₁.

In equation (2): y₂ = α₂ y₁ + β₁ x₁ + β₂ x₂
 → y₁ is endogenous ⇒ OLS cannot consistently estimate α₂.

Thus, neither α₁ nor α₂ can be estimated consistently via OLS. Instrumental Variables (IV) or Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) methods are required.

### c 

From the reduced-form:

y₂ = π₁ x₁ + π₂ x₂ + v₂
we can estimate π₁ and π₂:

π₁ = β₁ / (1 - α₁ α₂)
π₂ = β₂ / (1 - α₁ α₂)
This system has two equations and three unknowns (β₁, β₂, α₁α₂), so the structural parameters are not identified without additional instruments or restrictions.

### d 

Given the moment conditions:

E[x₁ (y₂ - π₁ x₁ - π₂ x₂)] = 0  
E[x₂ (y₂ - π₁ x₁ - π₂ x₂)] = 0  
Since x₁ and x₂ are exogenous (uncorrelated with v₂), these conditions hold and can be used for Method of Moments (MOM) estimation of π₁ and π₂.

### e 

Yes. Minimizing the squared residuals:

min ∑ (y₂ - π₁ x₁ - π₂ x₂)²
yields the same first-order conditions (moment conditions) as in (d), thus:

MOM estimation is equivalent to OLS in this context.

### f 

Given:

∑ x₁² = 1, ∑ x₁ x₂ = 0, ∑ x₂² = 1  
∑ x₁ y₂ = 3, ∑ x₂ y₂ = 4

Apply moment conditions:

3 - π₁ = 0 ⇒ π₁ = 3  
4 - π₂ = 0 ⇒ π₂ = 4

So the estimates are:

π₁ = 3  
π₂ = 4

### g 

Define the fitted value from the first stage:

ŷ₂ = 3x₁ + 4x₂
As ŷ₂ is constructed using only exogenous variables, it is uncorrelated with ε₁, making it a valid instrument for y₂.

Moment condition:

E[ŷ₂ (y₁ - α₁ y₂)] = 0
⇒ α₁ = ∑ ŷ₂ y₁ / ∑ ŷ₂ y₂
This is the Instrumental Variables (IV) estimator for α₁.

### h

Step 1: First Stage (Predict y₂)
  ŷ₂ = 3x₁ + 4x₂

Step 2: Second Stage (Regression)
  y₁ = α₁ ŷ₂ + error
⇒
  α₁ = ∑ ŷ₂ y₁ / ∑ ŷ₂²

This matches the IV estimator from part (g), confirming it is the Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) estimate for α₁.
