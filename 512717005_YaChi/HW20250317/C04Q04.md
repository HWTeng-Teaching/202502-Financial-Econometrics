# 對數模型
EXPER <- 1:30
RATING_hat <- 39.464 + 15.312 * log(EXPER)

## c
While EXPER = 10,
$\text{Marginal Effect} = \frac{\partial \widehat{RATING}}{\partial EXPER} = 0.990$

While EXPER = 20,
$\text{Marginal Effect} = \frac{\partial \widehat{RATING}}{\partial EXPER} = 0.990$

## d
While EXPER = 10,
$\frac{\partial \widehat{RATING}}{\partial EXPER} = \frac{15.312}{10} = 1.5312$

While EXPER = 20,
$frac{\partial \widehat{RATING}}{\partial EXPER} = \frac{15.312}{20} = 0.7656$

## e
While $R^2$ is higher, it shows that the more variance the model can explain, the better the fitting effect.

## f
Model 2 is more reasonable because it reflects the characteristic of diminishing marginal returns.
