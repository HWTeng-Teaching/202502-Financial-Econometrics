### (a) Expected Signs of Coefficients

We expect the sign of $\beta_2$ (QUANT) to be **negative**, because as the number of grams in a given sale increases, the price per gram should decrease due to quantity discounts.

The expected sign of $\beta_3$ (QUAL) is **positive**, since better quality (higher purity) cocaine should command a premium price.

The sign of $\beta_4$ (TREND) is **ambiguous**. If supply increases faster than demand over time, the price may fall, leading to a negative sign. If demand increases faster than supply, we might observe a positive trend in price.

### (b) Estimated Equation and Interpretation

The estimated regression equation is:

$$
\widehat{\text{PRICE}} = 90.8467 - 0.0600 \cdot \text{QUANT} + 0.1162 \cdot \text{QUAL} - 2.3546 \cdot \text{TREND}
$$

Standard errors (in parentheses below coefficients):

$$
(\text{se}) = (8.5803,\; 0.0102,\; 0.2033,\; 1.3861)
$$

$t$-values:

$$
(t) = (10.588,\; -5.892,\; 0.5717,\; -1.6987)
$$

Interpretation:

- $\beta_2 = -0.0600$: for each 1-unit increase in quantity, the price decreases by \$0.06.
- $\beta_3 = 0.1162$: for each 1-unit increase in quality, the price increases by \$0.1162.
- $\beta_4 = -2.3546$: for each additional year, the price decreases by \$2.3546 on average.

All coefficients have the expected signs.

### (c) $R^2$ and Explanation

The proportion of variation in cocaine price explained by QUANT, QUAL, and TREND is:

$$
R^2 = 0.5097
$$

This means 50.97% of the variation in price is explained by the model.

### (d) Hypothesis Test for Quantity Discount

**Hypotheses:**

- $H_0: \beta_2 \geq 0$
- $H_1: \beta_2 < 0$

**Test Statistic:**

$$
t = \frac{-0.05997}{0.01018} = -5.892
$$

Critical value at $\alpha = 0.05$ (one-tailed, df = 52): $t_{0.05, 52} = -1.675$

Since $-5.892 < -1.675$, we **reject** $H_0$. There is strong evidence that sellers offer discounts for larger quantities.

---

### (e) Hypothesis Test for Quality Premium

**Hypotheses:**

- $H_0: \beta_3 \leq 0$
- $H_1: \beta_3 > 0$

**Test Statistic:**

$$
t = \frac{0.1162}{0.2033} = 0.5717
$$

Critical value at $\alpha = 0.05$ (one-tailed): $t_{0.05, 52} = 1.675$

Since $0.5717 < 1.675$, we **fail to reject** $H_0$. There is **no statistical evidence** of a quality premium at the 5% significance level.

---

### (f) Annual Price Trend

The estimated coefficient for time (TREND) is:

$$
\beta_4 = -2.3546
$$

This implies the average annual **decrease in price** is \$2.35.

The negative sign may reflect an increase in supply over time, potentially due to improved production efficiency or greater market competition.
