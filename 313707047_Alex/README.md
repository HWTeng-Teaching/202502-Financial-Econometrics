I was born in Kaohsiung City, a passionate countryside area in southern Taiwan. During my high school and university years, I studied in Kaohsiung, and during the last semester of my undergraduate years,After seriously preparing for the exam and carefully thinking. I had the wonderful opportunity to be student in NYCU. but I am very worried about my graduate school career because my English proficiency is not good, and I have no background in finance. However, I always tell myself just do it
