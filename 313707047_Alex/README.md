### Map 
I was born in Kaohsiung City, a passionate countryside area in suothern Taiwan. During my high school and university years, I studied in Kaohsiung, and during the last semester of my undergraduate years,After seriously preparing for the exam and carefully thinking. I had the wonderful opportunity to be student in NYCU. but I am very worried about my graduate school career because my English proficiency is not good, and I have no background in finance. However, I always tell myself just do it

## Food 
Iâ€™ve always loved starch, but after I started working out, I fell in love with protein. 

## Smiles
I love spending time to teach math to junior and senior high school students. Enjoy the joy and financial benefits that work brings. so that I can afford to work out and invest in trading.
