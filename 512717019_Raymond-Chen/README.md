* In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton. 
* And I also like to travel and explore various landscapes around the world.
* For example, I took a trip to New Zealand last April, and it was absolutely stunning.
* Additionally, I had the exhilarating experience of skydiving and took a helicopter ride for the first time in my life.
