## MAP
I’m from Sanchong, a lively area in New Taipei City. I did my undergrad at Soochow University, majoring in Financial Engineering and Actuarial Mathematics. Now, I’m a first-year master's student in Information Management and Finance at NYCU.

## FOOD
Moving on to FOOD—one of my favorite topics! I love pasta, croffles, and sushi, especially anything with salmon. When I visited Japan, I fell in love with grilled beef tongue. Recently, I traveled to Shanghai and discovered my new favorites: pan-fried soup dumplings and snail rice noodle soup. I loved them so much that I ate them almost every day while I was there! And when it comes to drinks, my all-time favorite is the Original Milk Tea from SOMA—it has been my number one milk tea for years!

## SMILES
For the SMILES part—things that make me happy! I enjoy playing squash and biking while taking in the scenery—it really helps me relax. I’m also a huge baseball fan. I support the Rakuten Monkeys, and I always cheer for Team Taiwan in international tournaments. Besides that, I love camping and crocheting. Actually, the bag in the picture is one I made myself! I even crocheted a tiny scarf for my friend’s cat. I often make coasters and bags to share with my friends. And last but not least, I’m a big Disney fan! My dream is to visit every Disneyland around the world.
