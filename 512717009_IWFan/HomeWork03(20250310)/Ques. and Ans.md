## Ans:
**(a)**

Null and Alternative Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis (H₀): β₂ = 0 (GDPB has no effect on MEDALS)

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): β₂ > 0 (GDPB has a positive effect on MEDALS)

--------------------------------------------------------------

**(b)**

Test Statistic Calculation

t = (b₂ - 0) / se(b₂)

t = (0.01309 - 0) / 0.00215 = 6.09

If H₀ is true, t follows a t-distribution with df = 62.

--------------------------------------------------------------

**(c)**

Distribution Shift Under H₁

When H₀ is true, E(b₂) = 0. When H₁ is true, E(b₂) > 0, so the distribution shifts to the right.

--------------------------------------------------------------

**(d)**
Rejection Region at 1% Significance Level

t_{0.01,62} ≈ 2.39

If t > 2.39, we reject H₀.

--------------------------------------------------------------
**(e)**

Conducting the t-Test and Economic Interpretation

Since t = 6.09 > 2.39, we reject H₀, supporting H₁. GDP positively influences Olympic medal counts.

--------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion**

Based on the regression analysis and hypothesis test, we conclude that GDP has a significant positive impact on the number of Olympic medals won by a country. The computed t-statistic (6.09) is much greater than the critical value (2.39) at the 1% significance level, leading us to reject the null hypothesis (H₀: β₂ = 0) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H₁: β₂ > 0).

Economic Interpretation
Countries with higher GDP tend to win more Olympic medals.

This could be attributed to better sports infrastructure, higher investments in athlete training, and improved access to resources.

The 1% significance level means that we are 99% confident in our conclusion, with only a 1% chance of making a Type I error (incorrectly rejecting H₀).

Thus, economic strength (measured by GDP) appears to be a key factor influencing Olympic success.
