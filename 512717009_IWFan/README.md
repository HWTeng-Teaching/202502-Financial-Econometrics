I was born in Taoyuan City, which is one of the main Hakka communities in Taiwan. It has a rich Hakka culture. Now, I live in Hsinchu and work at the Taiwan Business Bank.

## food
I love trying different kinds of food. Whether itâ€™s high-end dishes like rich and tasty sea urchin or soft and juicy roast duck, or street food like flavorful skewers, marinated snacks, and seafood, I enjoy anything that has a special and delicious taste.

## Smiles
I also love traveling and experiencing the traditions and cultures of different countries. Sometimes, I follow my favorite idols and enjoy the happiness that music brings. One of my hobbies is making dried fruit by hand. I love both the creative process and the healthy, delicious results. Besides that, I challenged myself to get a yachting license, which became a special and unforgettable experience in my life.

I studied at the Institute of Financial Management at Jiaotong University. This helped me improve my professional knowledge and apply it to my work at the bank. I also share my ideas and experiences with managers across the bank, turning knowledge into practical solutions and creating greater value.
