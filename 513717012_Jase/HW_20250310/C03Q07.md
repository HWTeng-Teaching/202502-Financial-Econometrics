## a 

$\widehat{INCOME} = (a) + 1.029 \cdot BACHELOR$

$t = 4.31 = \frac{\beta_1}{se(\beta_1} = \frac{(a)}{2.672}$

a = 11.52

## b 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c027b4e7-f7c3-4f08-900c-34a69ccc922e)

It's positive and increasing with a constant rate.

```

## c 

$t = 10.75 = \frac{\beta_2}{se(\beta_2)} = \frac{(1.029)}{(c)}$

c = 0.0957

## d

$t=\frac{\hat{a}-10}{se(\hat{a})}$

$t=\frac{11.52-10}{2.672}=\frac{1.52}{2.672}=0.568$

## e

Reject area : { $t \mid t \leq -2.0096$ $\text{or}$ t $\geq 2.0096 \$}

## f

$\hat{\beta}\pm t_{\alpha/2}\times se(\hat{\beta})$

For 99% confidence level

$1.029\pm(2.68\times0.0958)$

$1.029\pm0.2567$

$(0.772,1.286)$

## g 

$H_0: \beta_2=1$

$H_1: \beta_2\neq1$

The t-statistic:

$t=\frac{1.029-1}{0.0958}=\frac{0.029}{0.0958}=0.303$

$t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, 49} = 2.009575$

t = 0.303, whichh falls in $-2.0096 \leq t \leq 2.0096$ , we fail to reject $H_0$

The impact of BACHELOR on INCOME is approximately 1-to-1, meaning a 1% increase in bachelor's degree attainment leads to about a $1,000 increase in per capita income.
