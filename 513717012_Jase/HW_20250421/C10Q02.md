**Model Specification**:

HOURS = β₁ + β₂·WAGE + β₃·EDUC + β₄·AGE + β₅·KIDSL6 + β₆·NWIFEINC + e

Where:
- HOURS: labor supply (hours worked)
- WAGE: hourly wage
- EDUC: years of education
- AGE: age of woman
- KIDSL6: number of children under 6
- NWIFEINC: non-wife household income

### (a) Expected Signs of Coefficients

| Variable     | Coefficient | Expected Sign | Reasoning |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| WAGE         | β₂          | Positive       | Higher wages raise opportunity cost of not working (substitution effect). |
| EDUC         | β₃          | Positive       | More education implies higher potential wage → stronger work incentives. |
| AGE          | β₄          | Ambiguous      | Older women may have more experience (↑HOURS) or approach retirement (↓HOURS). |
| KIDSL6       | β₅          | Negative       | More young children → more childcare responsibilities → less labor supply. |
| NWIFEINC     | β₆          | Negative       | Higher household income → less financial pressure to work. |

### (b) Why OLS Fails to Give Consistent Estimates

OLS assumption violated:
- **Endogeneity of WAGE**:
  - Omitted variable bias: unobserved factors (e.g. ability, motivation) may affect both WAGE and HOURS.
  - Reverse causality: more HOURS might increase productivity → higher WAGE.

→ OLS estimates will be **biased and inconsistent**.

### (c) Why EXPER and EXPER² Can Be Valid Instruments for WAGE

- **Relevance**:
  - EXPER and EXPER² are strongly correlated with WAGE (as per the Mincer wage equation).

- **Exogeneity**:
  - Conditional on EDUC, AGE, KIDSL6, NWIFEINC, these instruments do not directly affect HOURS.
  - They only affect HOURS indirectly through WAGE.

Therefore, EXPER and EXPER² meet both **relevance** and **exogeneity** criteria for valid IVs.

### (d) Identification of the Model

- Endogenous variable: 1 (WAGE)
- Instruments: 2 (EXPER, EXPER²)
- Exogenous regressors: 4 (EDUC, AGE, KIDSL6, NWIFEINC)

→ The model is **overidentified** (more instruments than endogenous variables).

→ **Order condition** is satisfied → model is **identified**.

### (e) Steps to Obtain IV/2SLS Estimates

**Step 1: First-Stage Regression**
- Regress WAGE on:
  EXPER, EXPER², EDUC, AGE, KIDSL6, NWIFEINC
- Obtain predicted values of WAGE (denoted as WAGE_hat)

**Step 2: Second-Stage Regression**
- Regress HOURS on:
  WAGE_hat, EDUC, AGE, KIDSL6, NWIFEINC

**Step 3: Inference**
- Use robust or heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors
- Optionally perform tests for instrument validity (e.g., Sargan test)
