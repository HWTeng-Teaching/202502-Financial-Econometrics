(a) Order Condition for Identification
The order condition requires that each equation exclude at least M - 1 = 7 variables to be identified.

Consumption Equation:
Includes 6 variables ⇒ excludes 10 ⇒  condition satisfied

Investment Equation:
Includes 5 variables ⇒ excludes 11 ⇒  condition satisfied

Private Sector Wage Equation:
Includes 5 variables ⇒ excludes 11 ⇒  condition satisfied

Conclusion: All equations satisfy the necessary order condition for identification.

(b) Rank Condition for Identification
The rank condition requires that the number of excluded exogenous variables be greater than or equal to the number of included endogenous regressors.

Consumption Equation:
Has 2 endogenous RHS variables; 5 exogenous variables are excluded ⇒ ✔️ condition satisfied

Investment Equation:
Has 1 endogenous RHS variable; excludes 5 exogenous variables ⇒ ✔️ condition satisfied

Private Sector Wage Equation:
Same as above ⇒ ✔️ condition satisfied

Conclusion: All equations satisfy the rank condition for identification.

(c) Reduced-Form Representation (Example: Private Sector Wages 

The reduced-form equation for wages is:

W_t = pi1 + pi2 * G_t + pi3 * W_zt + pi4 * TX_t + pi5 * TIME_t
    + pi6 * P_{t-1} + pi7 * K_{t-1} + pi8 * E_{t-1} + nu_t

​
 , and other RHS variables are exogenous. This expression shows how wage is predicted using only exogenous variables.

(d) 2SLS Estimation Procedure (Manual, No Software Command)

First Stage:

Perform OLS regressions of endogenous regressors (e.g., ) on all exogenous variables to obtain fitted values:

Ŵₜ , P̂ₜ

Then construct a composite variable combining the fitted wage and an exogenous wage indicator:

Wₜ* = Ŵₜ + W_zt
 
Second Stage:

Run OLS regression of the consumption equation using instrumented values:

CNₜ = β₀ + β₁·Wₜ* + β₂·Pₜ + β₃·Pₜ₋₁ + error

This is the second stage of the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation.

(e) Are the t-values the Same?
Coefficient estimates (point estimates):  Yes
The manual 2SLS procedure and built-in software 2SLS functions will produce the same coefficient estimates.

t-values (standard errors):  No

Manual second-stage OLS does not adjust for the uncertainty introduced in the first stage.

Built-in 2SLS commands do correct standard errors (e.g., using robust or clustered estimates that account for generated regressors).

Coefficients: Same
t-values: Different unless standard errors are properly corrected
