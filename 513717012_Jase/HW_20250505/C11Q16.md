We consider the following simultaneous equations system:

Demand Equation:
Qᵢ = α₁ + α₂ Pᵢ + ε_{di}

Supply Equation:
Qᵢ = β₁ + β₂ Pᵢ + β₃ Wᵢ + ε_{si}

Where:

Qᵢ: Quantity traded

Pᵢ: Price

Wᵢ: Wage rate (exogenous variable)

ε_{di}, ε_{si}: Structural error terms for demand and supply, respectively

(a) Deriving the Reduced-Form Equations
Step 1: Set Market Equilibrium Qᵢ^D = Qᵢ^S

Equating demand and supply:

α₁ + α₂ P + ε_d = β₁ + β₂ P + β₃ W + ε_s  
⇒ (α₂ - β₂) P = β₁ - α₁ + β₃ W + ε_s - ε_d  
⇒ P = [(β₁ - α₁) / (α₂ - β₂)] + [β₃ / (α₂ - β₂)] W + [(ε_s - ε_d) / (α₂ - β₂)]

This yields the reduced-form equation for price:
P = π₁ + π₂ W + v₁

Where:

π₁ = (β₁ - α₁) / (α₂ - β₂)

π₂ = β₃ / (α₂ - β₂)

v₁ = (ε_s - ε_d) / (α₂ - β₂)

Step 2: Substitute Reduced-Form P into the Demand Equation

Q = α₁ + α₂ P + ε_d  
  = α₁ + α₂ (π₁ + π₂ W + v₁) + ε_d  
  = (α₁ + α₂ π₁) + α₂ π₂ W + (α₂ v₁ + ε_d)
  
This yields the reduced-form equation for quantity:

Q = θ₁ + θ₂ W + v₂

Where:

θ₁ = α₁ + α₂ π₁

θ₂ = α₂ π₂

v₂ = α₂ v₁ + ε_d

(b) Which Parameters Are Identified?
From the reduced-form equations, we can estimate the following parameters:
π₁, π₂, θ₁, θ₂ — a total of 4 parameters.

However, the structural model includes 5 unknowns:
α₁, α₂, β₁, β₂, β₃.

Identification Summary:
The demand equation includes only P and uses W (excluded from the demand equation but included in supply) as an instrument, satisfying the order condition for identification.

The supply equation is not identified in this setup due to lack of valid exclusion restrictions.

Demand equation is identified
Supply equation is not identified

(c) Recovering Structural Parameters α₁ and α₂ from Reduced-Form Estimates

Given the estimated reduced-form equations:

Q̂ = 5 + 0.5 W  
P̂ = 2.4 + 1 W

This implies:

θ₁ = 5, θ₂ = 0.5

π₁ = 2.4, π₂ = 1

Using the relations:

θ₂ = α₂ π₂ ⇒ α₂ = 0.5 / 1 = 0.5

θ₁ = α₁ + α₂ π₁ ⇒ α₁ = 5 - 0.5 × 2.4 = 3.8

Identified Structural Parameters (from Demand Equation):
α₁ = 3.8

α₂ = 0.5

(d) Estimating Supply Equation Parameters Using Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)

The structural supply equation is:

Q = β₁ + β₂ P + β₃ W + ε_s

Step 1: First Stage – Predict P using the exogenous variable W

From the reduced-form:

P̂ = 2.4 + W
Step 2: Second Stage – Regress Q on P̂ and W

Perform OLS regression:

Q = β₁ + β₂ P̂ + β₃ W + error

This second-stage regression provides consistent estimates of the supply-side structural parameters:
β₁, β₂, and β₃.
